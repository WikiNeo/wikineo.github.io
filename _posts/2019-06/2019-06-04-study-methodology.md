After all these years of study, I try to summarize optimal ways for me to study and make best use of my time.

- Try to learn new and hard things in the morning, and switch to other topics after the lunch break
  - Try to concentrate for more than two hours, e.g. from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. 
  - Similarly, learn new theory in the morning, and do some practice and application after the lunch break

- When the mind is not so active, or you feel sleepy, try the following things
  - Do some review or summary work, like what I am doing now.
  - Change the subject you are studying on. You can switch from technical ones to non-technical ones.
