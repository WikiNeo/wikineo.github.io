## Functions

### int glfwinit(void)

This function initializes the GLFW library. Before most GFLFW functions can be used, GLFW must be initialized, and before an application terminates GLFW shouls be terminated in order to free any resources allocated during or after initialization.

If this function fails, it calls `glfwTerminate` before returning. If it succeeds, you should call `glfwTerminate` before the application exits.
