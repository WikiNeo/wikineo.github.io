With UDP, computer application can send messages, in this case referred to as datagrams,
to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Prior communications are not required
in order to set up communication channels or data paths.

UDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol
mechanisms. UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and prot numbers for addressing
different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. It has no handshaking
dialogues, and thus exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying
network; there is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection.

UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary
or are performed in the application; UDP avoid the overhead of such processing in the
protocol stack. Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is
preferable to waiting for packets delayed due to retransmission, which may not be an
option in a real-time system.
