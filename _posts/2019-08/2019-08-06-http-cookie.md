An **HTTP cookie** (also called **web cookie, internet cookie, browser cookie,** or
simply **cookie**) is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's
computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing. Cookie were designed to be
a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information (such as items added in
the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's browsing activity (including
clicking particular buttons, logging in, or record which pages were visited in the past).
They can also be used to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously
entered into form fields such as names, addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers.
