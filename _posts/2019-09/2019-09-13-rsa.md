RSA is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data
transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and it is different
from the decryption key which is kept secret (private).

A user of RSA creates and then publishes a public key based on two large prime numbers,
along with an auxiliary value. The prime numbers must be kept secret. Anyone can use the
public key to encrypt a message, but only someone with knowledge of the prime numbers can
decode the message.

RSA is a relatively slow algorithm, and because of this, it is less commonly used to
directly encrypt user data. More often, RSA passes encrypted shared keys for symmetric key
cryptography which in turn can perform bulk encryption-decryption operations at much
higher speed.
