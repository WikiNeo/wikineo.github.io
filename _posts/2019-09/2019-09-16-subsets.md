Given a set of **distinct** integers, *nums*, return all possible subsets.

**Note**: The solution must not contain duplicate subsets.

**Example**:

```bash
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output:
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```

## Thoughts

For an array of size N, there are 2^N arrays in final output.

For each element in the array, we can either choose it or not, which can be represented by
bit operation.

```bash
0x000   -> choose nothing
0x001   -> choose the last
0x010   -> choose the second
0x011   -> choose the last two
...
0x111   -> choose everything
```

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> subsets(vector<int>& nums){
    auto size = nums.size();
    auto N = 1 << size;
    vector<vector<int>> res;
    for (auto i = 0; i < N; i++){
        vector<int> v;
        for(auto j = 0; j < size; j++){
            if(i & (1 << j)){
                v.push_back(nums[j]);
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
