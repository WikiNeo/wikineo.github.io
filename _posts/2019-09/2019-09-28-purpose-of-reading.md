想起在知乎翻到的问题[读书早晚会忘，为什么还要读书？](https://www.zhihu.com/question/26978967/answer/349935353)
和高票的回答，提起来在quora的问答

- I have read lots of books but forgotten most of them. What's the purpose of
  reading?

  - When I was a child I ate a lot of food. Most of it is long gone and forgotten, but certainly some of it became my very bones and flesh.Think of reading as the same thing for the mind.

这不禁让人想起有段话，大概是说，现在的你，体现着你过去读的书，遇到的人，经历的事。
