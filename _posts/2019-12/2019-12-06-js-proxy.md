A proxy is an object that controls access to another object, called a subject.
The proxy and the subject have an identical interface and this allows us to
transparently swap one for the other; in fact, the alternative name for this
pattern is surrogate. A proxy intercepts all or some of the operations that are
meant to be executed on the subject, augmenting or complementing their behavior.

The Proxy and the subject have the same interface, and this is totally
transparent to the client, who can use one or the other interchangeably. The
Proxy forwards each operation to the subject, enhancing its behavior with
additional pre-processing or post-processing.

### Notes

It's important to observe that we are not talking about proxying between
classes; the proxy pattern involves wrapping actual instances of the subject,
thus preserving its state.

A proxy is useful in several circumstances; for example, consider the following
ones:

- **Data Validation**: The proxy validates the input before forwarding it to the
  subject
- **Security**: The proxy verifies that the client is authorized to perform the
  operation and it passes the request to the subject only if the outcome of the
  check is positive
- **Caching**: The proxy keeps an internal cache so that the operations are
  executed on the subject only if the data is not yet present in the cache
- **Lazy Initialization**: If the creation of the subject is expensive, the
  proxy can delay it to when it's really necessary
- **Logging**: The proxy intercepts the method invocations and the relative
  parameters, recoding them as they happen
- **Remote Objects**: A proxy can take an object that is located remotely, and
  make it appears local.

## Techniques for implementing proxies

When proxying an object, we can decide to intercept all its methods or only some
of them, while delegating the rest of them directly to the subject.

### Object composition

Composition is a technique whereby an object is combined with another object for
the purpose of extending or using its functionality. In the specific case of the
proxy pattern, a new object with the same interface as the subject is created,
and a reference to the subject is stored internally in the proxy in the form of
an instance variable or a closure variable. The subject can be injected from the
client at creation time or created by the proxy itself.

```javascript
function createProxy(subject){
    const proto = Object.getPrototypeOf(subject)

    function Proxy(subject){
        this.subject = subject
    }

    Proxy.prototype = Object.create(proto)

    // proxied method
    Proxy.prototype.hello = function(){
        return this.subject.hello() + ' world!';
    }

    // delegated method
    Proxy.prototype.goodbye = function(){
        return this.subject.goodbye.apply(this.subject, arguments)
    }

    return new Proxy(subject)
}
module.exports = createProxy
```

```javascript
function createProxy(subject){
    return {
        // proxied method
        hello: () => (subject.hello() + ' world!'),

        // delegated method
        goodbye: () => (subject.goodbye.apply(subject, arguments))
    }
}
```

### Object augmentation

**Object augmentation** (or **monkey patching**) is probably the most pragmatic
way of proxying individual methods of an object and consists of modifying the
subject directly by replacing a method with its proxied implementation

```javascript
function createProxy(subject) {
    const helloOrig = subject.hello;
    subject.hello = () => (helloOrig.call(this) + ' world!');

    return subject;
}
```

## Creating a logging Writable stream

We will now build an object that acts as a proxy to a Writable stream, by
intercepting all the calls to the `write()` method and logging a message every
time this happens.

```javascript
function createLoggingWritable(writableOrig){
    const proto = Object.getPrototypeOf(writableOrig)

    function LoggingWritable(writableOrig){
        this.writableOrig = writableOrig
    }

    LoggingWritable.prototype = Object.create(proto)

    LoggingWritable.prototype.write = function(chunk, encoding, callback){
        if(!callback && typeof encoding === 'function'){
            callback = encoding
            encoding = undefined
        }
        console.log('Writing ', chunk)
        return this.WritableOrig.write(chunk, encoding, function(){
            console.log('Finished writing ', chunk)
            callback && callback()
        })
    }

    LoggingWritable.prototype.on = function(){
        return this.writableOrig.on.apply(this.writableOrig, arguments)
    }

    LoggingWritable.prototype.on = function(){
        return this.writableOrig.end.apply(this.writableOrig, arguments)
    }

    return new LoggingWritable(writableOrig)
}
```

```javascript
const fs = require('fs')

const writable = fs.createWriteStream('test.txt')
const writableProxy = createLoggingWritable(writable)
writableProxy.write('First chunk')
writableProxy.write('Second chunk')
writable.write('This is not logged')
writableProxy.end()
```

## ES2015 Proxy

### Example 1

```javascript
const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler)
```

```javascript
const scientist = {
    name: 'nikola',
    surname: 'tesla'
}

const uppercaseScientist = new Proxy(scientist, {
    get: (target, property) => target[property].toUpperCase()
})

consol.log(uppercaseScientist.name, uppercaseScientist.surname)
// prints NIKOLA TESLA
```

### Example 2

```javascript
const evenNumbers = new Proxy([], {
    get: (target, index) => index * 2,
    has: (target, number) => number % 2 === 0
})
console.log(2 in evenNumbers)   // true
console.log(5 in evenNumbers)   // false
console.log(evenNumbers[7])     // 14
```
