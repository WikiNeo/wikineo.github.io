    <b>Theorem 1.1.1.</b> <i>There is no rational number whose square is 2</i>
</p>

<p>
    <i>Proof.</i> A rational number is any number that can be expressed in the form
    \(p/q\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are integers. Thus, what the theorem asserts is
    that no matter how \(p\) and \(q\) are chosen, it is never the case that
    \((p/q)^2 = 2\). The line of attack is indirect, using a type of argument
    referred to as a proof by contradiction. The idea is to assume that there
    <i>is</i> a rational number whose square is \(2\) and then proceed along logical
    lines until we reach a conclusion that is unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
    At this point, we will be forced to retrace our steps and reject the erroneous
    assumption that some rational number squared is equal to \(2\). In short, we
    will prove that the theorem is true by demonstrating that it cannot be false.
</p>

<p>
    And so assume, for contradiction, that there exists integers \(p\) and \(q\)
    satisfying
    $$
    (\frac{p}{q})^2 = 2 \tag{1}\label{1}
    $$ 
</p>

<p>
    We may also assume that \(p\) and \(q\) have no common factor, because, if
    they had one, we could simply cancel it out and rewrite the fraction in
    lowest terms. Now, equation \(\eqref{1}\) implies 
    $$
    p^2 = 2q^2  \tag{2}\label{2}
    $$
</p>

<p>
    From this, we can see that integer \(p^2\) is an even number (it is
    divisible by 2), and hence \(p\) must be even as well because the square of
    an odd number is odd. This allows us to write \(p = 2r\), where r is also an
    integer. If we substitute \(2r\) for \(p\) in equation \(\eqref{2}\), then a
    little algebra yields the relationship
    $$
    2r^2 = q^2
    $$
</p>

<p>
    But now the absurdity is at hand. This last equation implies that \(q^2\) is
    even, and hence \(q\) must also be even. Thus, we have shown that \(p\) and
    \(q\) are both even (i.e., divisible by 2) when they were original assumed
    to have no common factor. From this logical impasse, we can only conclude
    that equation \(eqref{1}\) cannot hold for any integer \(p\) and \(q\), and
    thus the theorem is proved.
