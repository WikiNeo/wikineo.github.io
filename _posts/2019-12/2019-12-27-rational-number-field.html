  The rational numbers are defined as 
  $$
  Q = \{ \text{all fractions \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are integers with
  \(q\) \(\ne\) 0} \}
  $$
</p>

<p>
  The properties of \(Q\) make up the definition of what is called a
  <i>field</i>. More formally stated, a field is any set where addition and
  multiplication are well-defined operations that are commutative, associative,
  and obey the familiar distributive property \(a(b + c) = ab + ac\). There must
  be an additive identity, and every element must have an additive inverse.
  Finally, there must be a multiplicative identity, and multiplicative inverses
  must exist for all nonzero elements of the field. Neither \(Z\) nor \(N\) is a
  field. The finite set \(\{\text{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}\}\) is a field when addition and
  multiplication are computed modulo \(5\).
