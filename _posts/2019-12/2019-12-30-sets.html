<p>Intuitively speaking, a set is any collection of objects. These objects are referred as
the elements of the set. For our purpose, the sets in question will most often be sets of
numbers, although we will also encounter sets of functions and, on a few occasions, setes
whose elements are other sets.</p>

<p>
    Give a set \(A\), we write \(A \in B\) if \(x\) (what ever if may be) is an element of
    \(A\). It \(x\) is not an element of \(A\), we write \(A \notin B\). Given two sets
    \(A\) and \(B\), the union is written \(A \cup B\) and is defined by asserting that
    $$
    \text{\(x \in A \cup B\) provided that \(x \in A\) or \(x \in B\) (or potentially both)}
    $$
    The intersection \(A \cap B\) is the set defined by the rule
    $$
    \text{\(x \in A \cap B\) provided that \(x \in A\) and \(x \in B\)}
    $$
</p>

<p>
    The set \(\emptyset\) is called the empty set and is understood to be the set that contains
    no elements. An equivalent statement would be to say that \(E\) and \(S\) are disjoint.
</p>

<p>
    The inclusion relationship \(A \subseteq B \) or \(B \supseteq \ A\) is used to
    indicate that every element of \(A\) is also an element of \(B\). In this case, we say
    \(A\) is a subset of \(B\), or \(B\) contains \(A\). To asset that \(A = B\) means
    that \(A \subseteq B\) and \(B \subseteq A \). Put another way, \(A\) and \(B\) have
    exactly the same elements.
</p>

<p>
    As mentioned, most of the sets we encounter will be sets of real numbers. Give \(A
    \subseteq R\), the complement of A, written \(A^\complement\), refers to the set of
    all elements of \(R\) not in \(A\). Thus, for \(A \subseteq R\),
    $$
    \text{\(A^\complement\) = {\(x \in R\) : \(x \notin A\)}}
    $$
    De Morgan's Laws states that
    $$
    \text{
        \((A \cap B)\complement = A^\complement \cup B^\complement\) and 
        \((A \cup B)\complement = A^\complement \cap B^\complement\)
    }
    $$
