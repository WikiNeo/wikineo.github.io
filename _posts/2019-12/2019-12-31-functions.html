    <b>Definition 1.2.3</b>
    Given two sets \(A\) and \(B\), a function from \(A\) to \(B\) is a rule or mapping
    that takes each element \(x \in A \) and associate with it a single element of \(B\).
    In this case, we write \(f : A \to B\). Given an element \(x \in A\), the expression
    \(f(x)\) is used to represent the element of \(B\) associated with \(x\) by \(f\). The
    set \(A\) is called the domain of \(f\). The range of f is not necessarily equal to
    \(B\) but refers to the subset of \(B\) by \(\text{\{\(y \in B\) : \(y = f(x)\) for some
   \(x \in A\)\} }\).

    <b>Triangle Inequality</b>. The absolute value function is so important that it merits
    the special notation \(|x|\) in place of the usual \(f(x)\) or \(g(x)\). It is defined
    for every real number via the piecewise definition
    $$
    |x| = \begin{cases}
    x,  & \text{if $x \geqslant 0 $ } \\
    -x, & \text{if $x < 0$ }
    \end{cases}
    $$
    With respect to multiplication and division, the absolute value functions satisfies
    $$
    |ab| = |a||b|   \\
    |a + b| \leqslant |a| + |b|
    $$
    Verifying these properties is just a matter of examining the different cases that
    arise when \(a\), \(b\) and \(a + b\) are positive and negative. The second property is
    called triangle inequality.

    Given three real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we have
    $$
    |a - b| = |(a - c) + (c - b)|
    $$
    By the triangle inequality
    $$
    |(a - c) + (c - b)| \leqslant |a - c| + |c - b|
    $$
    so we get
    $$
    |a - b| \leqslant |a - c| + |c - b|
    $$
    Now, the expression \(|a - b|\) is equal to \(|b - a|\) and is best understood as the
    distance between the points \(a\) and \(b\)  on the number line. With this interpretation,
    we know why it is called triangle inequality.
