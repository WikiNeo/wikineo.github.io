    Writing rigorous mathematical proofs is a skill best learned by doing, and there is plenty
    of on-the-job training just ahead. As Hardy indicates, there is an artistic quality to
    mathematics of this type, which may or may not come easily, but that is not to say that
    anything especially mysterious is happening. A proof is an essay of sorts. It is a set of
    carefully crafted directions, which, when followed, should leave the reader absolutely
    convinced of the truth of the proposition in question. To achieve this, the steps in a
    proof must follow logically from previous steps or be justified by some other agree-upon
    set of facts. In addition to being valid, these steps must also fit coherently together
    to form a cogent argument. Mathematics has a specialized vocabulary, to be sure, but that
    does not exempt a good proof from being written in grammatically correct English

    The one proof we have seen at this point uses an indirect strategy called proof by
    contraction. This powerful technique will be employed a number of times in our
    upcoming work. Nevertheless, most proofs are direct. (It also bears mentioning that
    using an indirect proof when a direct proof is available is generally considered bad
    form.) A direct proof begins from some valid statement, most often taken from the
    theorem's hypothesis, and the proceeds through rigorous logical deductions to a
    demonstration of the theorem's conclusion. An indirect proof always begins by negating
    what it is we would like to prove.
