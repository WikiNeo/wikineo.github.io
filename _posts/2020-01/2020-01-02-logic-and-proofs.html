    Writing rigorous mathematical proofs is a skill best learned by doing, and
    there is plenty of on-the-job training just ahead. As Hardy indicates, there
    is an artistic quality to mathematics of this type, which may or may not
    come easily, but that is not to say that anything especially mysterious is
    happening. A proof is an essay of sorts. It is a set of carefully crafted
    directions, which, when followed, should leave the reader absolutely
    convinced of the truth of the proposition in question. To achieve this, the
    steps in a proof must follow logically from previous steps or be justified
    by some other agreed-upon set of facts. In addition to being valid, these
    steps must also fit coherently together to form a cogent argument.

    The one proof we have seen at this point uses an indirect strategy called
    proof by contradiction. This powerful technique will be employed a number of
    times in our upcoming work. Nevertheless, most proofs are direct. (It also
    bears mentioning that using an indirect proof when a direct proof is
    available is generally considered bad form.) A direct proof begins from some
    valid statement, most often taken from the theorem's hypothesis, and then
    proceeds through rigorously logical deductions to a demonstration of the
    theorem's conclusion. An indirect proof always begins by negating what it is
    we would like to prove. The argument then proceeds until a logical
    contraction with some other accepted fact is uncovered. Many times, this
    accepted fact is part of the hypothesis of the theorem. When the
    contradiction is with the theorem's hypothesis, we technically have what is
    called a contrapositive proof.

    <b>Theorem 1.2.6</b>
    Two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are equal if and only if for every real
    number \(\epsilon > 0\) if follows that \( |a - b| < \epsilon\)
</p>

<p>

    There are two key phrases in the statement of  this proposition that warrant
    special attention. One is "for every", the other is "if and only if". To say
    "if and only if" in mathematics is an economical way of stating that the
    proposition is true in two directions. In the forward direction, we must
    prove the statement
</p>

<p>
    if \(a = b\), the for every real number \(\epsilon > 0\) if follows that
    \(|a - b| < \epsilon\)
</p>

<p>

    We must also prove the converse statement
</p>

<p>
    If for every real number \(\epsilon > 0\) it follows that \(|a - b| <
    \epsilon\), then we must have \(a = b\)
</p>

<p>

    For the proof of the first statement, there is really not much to say. if
    \(a = b\), then \(|a - b| = 0\), and so certainly \(|a - b| < \epsilon\) no
    matter that \(\epsilon > 0\) is chosen.
</p>

<p>
    For the second statement, we give a proof by contraction. The conclusion of
    the proposition in this direction states that \(a = b\), so we assume that
    \(a \neq b\). Heading off in search of a contradiction brings us to a
    consideration of the phrase "for every \(\epsilon\)." Some equivalent ways to
    state the hypothesis would be to say that "for all possible choices of
    \(epsilon > 0\)" or "no matter how \(\epsilon > 0\) is selected, it is always
    the case that \(|a - b| < \epsilon\)." But assuming \(a \neq b\), the choice
    of 
    $$
    \epsilon_0 = |a - b| > 0
    $$
    poses a serious problem. We are assuming that \(|a - b| < \epsilon\) is true
    for every \(\epsilon > 0\), so this must certainly be true for the
    particular \(\epsilon_0\) just defined. However, the statements
    $$
    \text{\(|a - b| < \epsilon_0\) and \(|a - b| = \epsilon_0\)}
    $$
    cannot both be true. This contradiction means that our initial assumption
    that \(a \neq b\) is unacceptable. Therefore, \(a = b\), and the indirect
    proof is complete.

<p>
    One of the most fundamental skills required for reading and writing analysis
    proofs is the ability to confidently manipulate the quantifying phrases "for
    all" and "there exists."
