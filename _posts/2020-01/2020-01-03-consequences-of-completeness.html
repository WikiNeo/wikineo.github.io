    The first application of the Axiom of Completeness is a result that may look
    like a more natural way to mathematically express the sentiment that the
    real line contains no gap.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Theorem 1.4.1</b>
    <b>Nested Interval Property</b> For each \(n \in N\), assume we are given a
    closed interval \(I_n = [a_n, b_n] = \{x \in R : a_n \leqslant x \leqslant
    b_n\}\). Assume also that each \(I_n\) contains \(I_{n + 1}\). Then, the
    resulting nested sequence of closed intervals
    $$
    I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq I_3 \supseteq I_4 \supseteq \cdot \cdot \cdot
    $$
    has a nonempty intersection; that is, \(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n \neq \emptyset\)
</p>

<p>

    <i>Proof.</i> In order to show that \(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n\) is not
    empty, we are going to use the Axiom of Completeness (AoC) to produce a
    single real number \(x\) satisfying \(x \in I_n\) for every \(n \in N\).
    Now, Aoc is a statement about bounded sets, and the one we want to consider
    is the set
    $$
    A = \{a_n : n \in N\}
    $$
    of left-hand endpoints of the intervals.
</p>

<p>

    Because the intervals are nested, we see that every \(b_n\) servers as an
    upper bound for \(A\). Thus, we are justified in setting
    $$
    x = sup A.
    $$
    Now, consider a particular \(I_n = [a_n, b_n]\). Because \(x\) is an upper
    bound for \(A\), we have \(a_n \leqslant x\). The fact that each \(b_n\) is
    an upper bound for \(A\) and the \(x\) is the least upper bound implies \(x
    \leqslant b_n\).
</p>

<p>
    Altogether then, we have \(a_n \leqslant x \leqslant b_n\), which means \(x
    \in I_n\) for every choice of \(n \in N\). Hence, \(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty
    I_n\), and the intersection is not empty.
