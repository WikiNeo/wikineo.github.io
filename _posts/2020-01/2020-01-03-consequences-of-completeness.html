    The first application of the Axiom of Completeness is a result that may look
    like a more natural way to mathematically express the sentiment that the
    real line contains no gap.

    <b>Nested Interval Property</b> For each \(n \in N\), assume we are give a
    closed interval \(I_n = [a_n, b_n] = \{x \in R : a_n \leqslant x \leqslant
    b_n\}\). Assume also that each \(I_n\) contains \(I_{n + 1}\). Then, the
    resulting nested sequence of closed intervals
    $$
    I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq I_3 \supseteq I_4 \supseteq \cdot \cdot \cdot
    $$
    has a nonempty intersection; that is, \(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n \neq \emptyset\)
