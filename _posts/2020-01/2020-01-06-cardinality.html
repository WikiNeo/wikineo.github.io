    The term cardinality is used in mathematics to refer to the size of a set. 
</p>

<p>

    A function \(f : A \to B\) is one-to-to \((1-1\)) if \(a_1 \neq a_2\) in \(A\)
    implies that \(f(a_1) \neq f(a_2)\) in \(B\). The function is onto if, given
    any \(b in B\), it is possible to find an element \(a \in A\) for which
    \(f(a) = b\)
</p>

<p>
    A function \(f : A \to B\) that is both \((1-1)\) and onto provides us with
    exactly what we mean by a \((1-1)\) correspondence between two sets. The
    property of being \((1-1)\) means that no two elements of \(A\) correspond
    to the same element of \(B\), and the property of being onto ensures that
    every element of \(B\) corresponds to something in \(A\)
</p>

<p>

    The set \(A\) has the same cardinality as \(B\) if there exists \(f : A \to
    B\) that is \(1-1\) and onto. In this case, we write \(A ~ B\)
</p>

<p>
    A set is countable if \(N ~ A\). An infinite set that is not countable is
    called an uncountable set.
