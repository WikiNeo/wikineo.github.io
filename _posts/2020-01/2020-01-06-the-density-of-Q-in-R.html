The set \(Q\) is an extension of \(N\), and \(R\) in turn is an extension of
\(Q\). The next few results indicate how \(N\) and \(Q\) sit inside of \(R\).
</p>

<p>
    <b>Archimedean Property</b>
    <ol>

        <li>
            Given any number \(x \in R\), there exists an \(n \in N\) satisfying
            \(n > x\)
        </li>
        <li>
            Given any real number \(y > 0\), there exists an \(n \in N\)
            satisfying \(1/n < y\).
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>

    <i>Proof.</i> Part \((i)\) of the proposition states that \(N\) is not
    bounded above. There has never been any doubt about the truth of this, and
    it could be reasonably argued that we should not have to prove it at all,
    especially in light of the fact that we have decided to take other familiar
    properties of \(N\), \(Z\), and \(Q\) as given.
</p>

<p>
    The counterargument is that there is still a great deal of mystery about
    what real numbers actually are. What we have said so far is that \(R\) is an
    extension of \(Q\) that maintains the algebraic and order properties of the
    rationals but also possesses the least upper bound property articulated in
    the Axiom of Completeness. In the absence of any other information about
    \(R\), we have to consider the possibility that in extending \(Q\) we
    unwittingly acquired some new numbers that are upper bounds for \(N\). In
    fact, as disorienting as it may sound, there are ordered filed extensions of
    \(Q\) that include "numbers" bigger than every natural number. It asserts
    that the real numbers do not contain such exotic creatures. The Axiom of
    Completeness, which we adopted to patch the holes in \(Q\), carries with it
    the implication that \(N\) is an unbounded subset of \(R\).
</p>

<p>
    And so to the proof. Assume, for contradiction, that \(N\) is bounded above.
    By the Axiom of Completeness (AoC), \(N\) should then have a least upper
    bound, and we can set \(\alpha = sup N\). If we consider \(\alpha - 1\),
    then we no longer have an upper bound, and therefore there exists an \(n \in
    N\) satisfying (\\alpha - 1 < n\). But this is equivalent to \(\alpha < n +
    1\). Because \(n + 1 \in N\), we have a contraction to the fact that
    \(\alpha\) is supposed to be an upper bound for \(N\). (Notice that the
    contradiction here depends only on AoC and the fact the \(N\) is closed
    under addition)
</p>

<p>

    Part \((ii)\) follows from \((i)\) by letting \(x = 1/y\)
</p>

<p>
    This familiar property of \(N\) is the key to an extremely important fact
    about how \(Q\) fits inside \(R\).
</p>

<p>
    <b>Density of Q in R</b>. For every two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) with
    \(a < b\), there exists a rational number \(r\) satisfying \(a < r < b\)
</p>

<p>
    <i>Proof.</i> A rational number is q quotient of integers, so we must
    produce \(m \in Z\) and \(n \in N\) so That
    $$
    a < \frac{m}{n} < b \tag{1}\label{1}
    $$
    The first step is to choose the denominator \(n\) large enough so that
    consecutive increments of size \(1/n\) are too close together to "step over"
    the interval \((a, b)\)
</p>

<p>
    Using the Archimedean Property, we may pick \(n \in N\) large enough so that
    $$
    \frac{1}{n} < b - a \tag{2}\label{2}
    $$
    Inequality \(\eqref{1}\) is equivalent to \(na < m < nb\). With \(n\)
    already chosen, the idea now is to choose \(m\) to be the smallest integer
    greater than \(na\). In other words, pick \(m \in Z\) so that
    $$
    m - 1 \leqslant na < m  \tag{3}\label{3}
    $$
    Now, inequality \(\eqref{3}\) immediately yields \(a < m/n\), which is half of the battle.
    Inequality \(\eqref{2}\) is equivalent to \(a < b - 1/n\),we can use
    \(\eqref{3}\) to write
    $$
    \begin{align}
        m & \leqslant na + 1 \\
        & < n(b - \frac{1}{n}) + 1 \\
        & = nb
    \end{align}
    $$
    Because \(m < nb\) implies \(m/n < b\), we have \(a < m/n < b\), as desired.
