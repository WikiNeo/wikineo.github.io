    <b>Theorem 1.4.5</b>
    <i>
        There exists a real number \(a \in R\) satisfying \(\alpha^2 = 2\)
    </i>
</p>

<p>

    <i>Proof.</i> Consider the set
    $$
    T = \{t \in R : t^2 < 2\}
    $$
    and set \(\alpha = sup T\). We are going to prove \(\alpha^2 = 2\) by ruling
    out the possibilities \(\alpha^2 < 2\) and \(\alpha^2 > 2\). Keep in mind
    that there are two parts to the definition of \(sup T\), and they will both
    be important. (This always happens when a supremum is used in an argument.)
    The strategy is to demonstrate that \(\alpha^2 < 2\) violates the fact that
    the \(\alpha\) is an upper bound for \(T\), and \(\alpha^2 > 2\) violates
    the fact that it is the least upper bound.
</p>

<p>
    Let's first see what happens if we assume \(\alpha^2 < 2\). In search of an
    element of \(T\) that is larger than \(\alpha\), write
    $$
    \begin{align}
    (\alpha + \frac{1}{n})^2 &= \alpha^2 + \frac{2\alpha}{n} + \frac{1}{n^2} \\
    &< \alpha^2 + \frac{2\alpha}{n} + \frac{1}{n} \\
    &= \alpha^2 + \frac{2\alpha + 1}{n}
    \end{align}
    $$
    But assuming \(\alpha^2 < 2\) gives us a little space in which to fit the
    \((2\alpha + 1)/n\) term and keep the total less than \(2\). Specifically,
    chose \(n_0 \in N\) large enough so that
    $$
    \frac{1}{n_0} < \frac{2 - \alpha^2}{2\alpha + 1}
    $$
    This implies \((2\alpha + 1)/n_0 < 2 - \alpha^2\), and consequently that
    $$
    (\alpha + \frac{1}{n_0})^2 < \alpha^2 + (2 - \alpha^2) = 2
    $$
    Thus, \(\alpha + 1/n_0 \in T\), contradicting the fact that \(\alpha\) is an
    upper bound for \(T\). We conclude that \(\alpha^2 < 2\) cannot happen.
</p>

<p>
    Now, what about the case \(\alpha^2 > 2\)? We write
    $$
    \begin{align}
    (\alpha - \frac{1}{n})^2 &= \alpha^2 - \frac{2\alpha}{n} + \frac{1}{n^2} \\
        &> \alpha^2 - \frac{2\alpha}{n}
    \end{align}
    $$
</p>

<p>
    A small modification of this proof can be made to show that \(\sqrt{x}\)
    exists for any \(x \leqslant 0\). A formula for expanding \((\alpha +
    1/n)^m\) called the binomial formula can be used to show that
    \(\sqrt[m]{x}\) exists for arbitrary values of \(m \in N\)
