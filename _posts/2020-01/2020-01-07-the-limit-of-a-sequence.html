    A sequence is a function whose domain is \(N\).
</p>

<p>
    <b>Convergence of a Sequence</b> A sequence \((a_n)\) converges to a real
    number \(a\) if, for every positive number \(\epsilon\), there exists an \(N
    \in N\) such that whenever \(n \leqslant N\) it follows that \(|a_n - a| < \epsilon\)
</p>

<p>
    To indicate that \((a_n)\) converges to \(a\), we usually write either
    \(\lim a_n = a\) or \((a_n) \to a\). The notation \(\lim_{n \to \infty}
    a_n\) is also standard.
</p>

<p>
    Given a real number \(a \in R\) and a positive number \(\epsilon > 0\) the
    set
    $$
    V_\epsilon(a) = \{x \in R : |x - a| < \epsilon\}
    $$
    is called the \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood of \(a\).
</p>

<p>
    Notice that \(V_\epsilon(a)\) consists of all of those points whose distance
    from \(a\) is less than \(\epsilon\). Said another way, \(V_\epsilon(a)\) is
    an interval, centered at \(a\), with radius \(\epsilon\).
</p>

<p>

    <b>Convergence of a Sequence: Topological Version</b>. A sequence \((a_n)\)
    converges to \(a\) if, given any \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood \(V_\epsilon(a)\)
    of \((a)\), there exists a point in the sequence after which all of the
    terms are in \(V_\epsilon(a)\). In other words, every
    \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood contains all but a finite number of the terms of \((a_n)\)
</p>

<p>

    $$
    \lim(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}) = 0
    $$
</p>

<p>
    <i>Proof.</i> Let \(\epsilon > 0\) be an arbitrary positive number. Choose a
    natural number \(N\) satisfying
    $$
    N > \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}
    $$
    Let \(n \geqslant N\). Then
    $$
    n > \frac{1}{\epsilon^2} \text{ implies } \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} < \epsilon
    \text{ and hence } |a_n - 0| < \epsilon
    $$

    <b>Uniqueness of Limits.</b> The limit of a sequence, when it exists, must
    be unique.
