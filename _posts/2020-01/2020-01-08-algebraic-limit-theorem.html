    <i>Proof.</i>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Consider the case where \(c \neq 0\). We want to show that the
            sequence \((ca_n)\) converges to\(ca\). Let \(\epsilon\) be some
            arbitrary positive number. Our goal is to find some point in the
            sequence \(ca_n\) after which we have
            $$
            |ca_n - ca| < \epsilon
            $$
            Now,
            $$
            |ca_n - ca| = |c||a_n - a|
            $$
            We are given that \((a_n) \to a\), so we know we can make \(|a_n -
            a|\) as small as we like. We can choose an \(N\) such that
            $$
            |a_n - a| < \frac{\epsilon}{|c|}
            $$
            whenever \(n \geqslant N\). To see that this \(N\) indeed works,
            observe that, for all \(n \geqslant N\),
            $$
            |ca_n - ca| = |c||a_n - a| < |c|\frac{\epsilon}{|c|} = \epsilon
            $$
            The case \(c = 0\) reduces to showing that the constant sequence
            \((0,0,0,...)\) converges to \(0\).
        </li>
        <li>
            To prove this statement, we need to argue that the quantity
            $$
            |(a_n + b_n) - (a + b)|
            $$
            can be made less than an arbitrary \(\epsilon\) using the assumption
            that \(|a_n - a|\) and \(|b_n - b|\) can be made as small as we like
            for large \(n\). The first step is to use the triangle inequality to
            say
            $$
            |(a_n + b_n) - (a + b)| = |(a_n - a) + (b_n - b)| \leqslant |a_n -
            a| + |b_n - b|
            $$
            Again, we let \(\epsilon > 0\) be arbitrary. The technique this time
            is to divide the \(\epsilon\) between the two expressions on the
            right-hand side in the preceding inequality. Using the hypothesis
            that \((a_n) \to a\), we know there exits an \(N_1\) such that
            $$
            |a_n - a| < \frac{\epsilon}{2} \text{ whenever } n \geqslant N_1
            $$
            Likewise, the assumption that \((b_n) \to b\) means that we can
            choose an \(N_2\) so that
            $$
            |b_n - b| < \frac{\epsilon}{2} \text{ whenever } n \geqslant N_2
            $$
            By choosing \(N = max\{N_1, N_2\}\), we get
            $$
            \begin{align}
            |(a_n + b_n) - (a + b)| &\leqslant |a_n - a| + |b_n - b| \\
            &< \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon
            \end{align}
            $$
            for all \(n \geqslant N\), as desired.
        </li>
        <li>
            To show that \((a_nb_n) \to ab\), we begin by observing that
            $$
            \begin{align}
            |a_nb_n - ab| &= |a_nb_n - ab_n + ab_n - ab| \\
            &= |a_nb_n - ab_n| + |ab_n - ab| \\
            &= |b_n||a_n - a| + |a||b_n - b|
            \end{align}
            $$
            <p>
            In the initial step, we subtracted and then added \(ab_n\), wich
            created an opportunity to use the triangle inequality. Essentially,
            we have broken up the distance from \(a_nb_n\) to \(ab\) with a
            midway point and are using the sum of the two distances to
            overestimate the original distance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Letting \(\epsilon > 0\) be arbitrary, we again proceed with the
                strategy of making each piece in the preceding inequality less
                than \(\epsilon/2\). For the piece on the right-hand side
                \((|a||b_n - b|)\), if \(a \neq 0\) we can choose \(N_1\) so
                that
                $$
                n \geqslant N_1 \text{ implies } |b_n - b| < \frac{1}{|a|}\frac{\epsilon}{2}
                $$
                Getting the term on left-hand side \(|b_n||a_n - a|\) to be less
                than \(\epsilon/2\) is complicated by the fact that we have a
                variable quantity \(|b_n|\) to contend with as opposed to the
                constant \(|a|\) we encountered in the right-hand term. The idea
                is to replace \(|b_n|\) with a worst-case estimate. Using the
                fact that convergent sequences are bounded, we know there exists
                a bound \(M > 0\) satisfying \(|b_n| \leqslant M\) for all \(n
                \in M\). Now we can choose \(N_2\) so that
                $$
                |a_n - a| < \frac{1}{M}\frac{\epsilon}{2} \text{ whenever } n
                \geqslant N_2
                $$
                To finish the argument, pick \(N = max{N_1, N_2}\), and observe
                that if \(n \geqslant N\), then
                $$
                \begin{align}
                |a_nb_n - ab| &\leqslant |a_nb_n - ab_n| + |ab_n - ab| \\
                &= |b_n||a_n - a| + |a||b_n - b| \\
                &\leqslant M|a_n - a| + |a||b_n - b| \\
                &< M(\frac{\epsilon}{M2}) + |a|(\frac{\epsilon}{|a|2}) = \epsilon
                \end{align}
                $$
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>

            This final statement will follow from previous proof if we can prove
            that
            $$
            (b_n) \to b \text{ implies } (\frac{1}{b_n}) \to \frac{1}{b}
            $$
            whenever \(b \neq 0\). We have
            $$
            |\frac{1}{b_n} - \frac{1}{b}| = \frac{|b - b_n|}{|b||b_n|}
            $$
            Because \((b_n) \to b\), we can make the preceding numerator as
            small as we like by choosing \(n\) large. The problem comes in that
            we need a worst-case estimate on the size of \(1/(|b||b_n|)\).
            Because the \(b_n\) terms are in the denominator, we are no longer
            interested in an upper bound on |b_n| but rather in an inequality of
            the form \(|b_n| \geqslant \delta > 0\). This will then lead to a
            bound on the size of \(1/(|b||b_n|)\)
            <p>

                The trick is to look far enough out into the sequence \(b_n\) so
                that the terms are closer to b than they are to 0. Consider the
                particular value \(\epsilon_0 = |b|/2\). Because \((b_n) \to
                b\), there exists an \(N_1\) such that \(|b_n - b| < |b|/2\) for
                all \(n \geqslant N_1\). This implies \(|b_n| > |b|/2\)
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, choose \(N_2\) so that \(n \geqslant N_2\) implies
                $$
                |b_n - b| < \frac{\epsilon|b|^2}{2}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, if we let \(N = max\{N_1, N_2\}\), then \(n \geqslant
                N\) implies 
                $$
                |\frac{1}{b_n} - \frac{1}{b}| = |b - b_n|\frac{1}{|b||b_n|}
                < \frac{\epsilon|b|^2}{2}\frac{1}{|b|\frac{|b|}{2}} = \epsilon
                $$
