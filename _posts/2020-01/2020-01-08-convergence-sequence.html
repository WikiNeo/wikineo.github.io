    The real purpose of creating a rigorous definition for convergence of a
    sequence is not to have a tool to verify computational statements such as
    \(\lim 2n/(n+2) = 2\). The point of having such a logically tight
    description of convergence is so that we can confidently prove statements
    about convergent sequences in general. We are ultimately trying to resolve
    arguments about what is and is not true regarding the behavior of limits
    with respect to the mathematical manipulations we intended to inflict on them.

    A sequence \((x_n)\) is bounded if there exists a number \(M > 0\) such that
    \(|x_n| \leqslant M\) for all \(n \in N\)
</p>

<p>
    Geometrically, this means that we can find an interval \([-M, M]\) that
    contains every term in the sequence \((x_n)\)
</p>

<p>
    Every convergent sequence is bounded.
</p>

<p>
    <i>Proof.</i> Assume \((x_n)\) converges to a limit \(l\). This means that
    given a particular value of \(\epsilon\), say \(\epsilon = 1\), we know
    there must exist an \(N in N\) such that if \(n \geqslant N\), then \(x_n\)
    is in the interval \((l - 1, l + 1)\). Not knowing whether \(l\) is positive
    or negative, we can certainly conclude that 
    $$
    |x_n| < |l| + 1
    $$
    for all \(n \geqslant N\)
</p>

<p>
    We still need to worry about the terms in the sequence that come before the
    \(Nth\) term. Because there are only a finite number of these, we let
    $$
    M = max\{|x_1|, |x_2|, |x_3|,...,|x_{N - 1}|, |l| + 1\}
    $$
    It follows that \(|x_n| \leqslant M\) for all \(n \in N\).
