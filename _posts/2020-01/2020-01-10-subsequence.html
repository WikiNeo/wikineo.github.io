    <b>Definition 2.5.1</b>
    Let \((a_n)\) be a sequence of real numbers, and let \(n_1 < n_2 < n_3 < n_4
    < n_5 < ...\) be an increasing sequence of natural numbers. Then the
    sequence
    $$
    (a_{n_1}, a_{n_2}, a_{n_3}, a_{n_4}, a_{n_5},...)
    $$
    is called a subsequence of \((a_n)\) and is denoted by \((a_{n_k})\), where
    \(k \in N\) indexes the subsequence.

    <b>Theorem 2.5.2</b>
    <i>
        Subsequences of a convergent sequence converge to the same limit as the
        original sequence.
    </i>
</p>


<p>
    <i>Proof.</i> Assume \((a_n) \to a\), and let \(a_{n_k}\) be a subsequence.
    Given \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists \(N\) such that \(|a_n - a| <
    \epsilon\) whenever \(n \geqslant N\). Because \(n_k \geqslant k\) for all
    \(k\), the same \(N\) will suffice for the subsequence; that is, \(|a_{n_k}
    - a| < \epsilon\) whenever \(k \geqslant N\)
