    <b>Definition 2.6.1</b>
    A sequence \((a_n)\) is called a <i>Cauchy sequence</i> if, for every
    \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists an \(N \in N\) such that whenever \(m, n
    \geqslant N\) it follows that \(|a_n - a_m| < \epsilon\).
</p>

<p>
    <b>Theorem 2.6.2</b>
    <i>Every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence.</i>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Lemma 2.6.3</b>
    <i>Cauchy sequences are bounded.</i>
</p>

<p>
    <i>Proof.</i> Given \(\epsilon = 1\), there exists an \(N\) such that \(|x_m
    - x_n| < 1\)for all \(m, n \geqslant N\). Thus, we must have \(|x_n| < |x_N|
    + 1\) for all \(n \geqslant N\). It follows that
    $$
    M = max\{|x_1|,|x_2|,|x_3|,\cdot \cdot \cdot, |x_{N-1}|,|x_N| + 1\}
    $$
    is a bound for the sequence \((x_n)\)
</p>

<p>
    <b>Theorem 2.6.4</b>
    <b>Cauchy Criterion</b>. <i>A sequence converges if and only if it is a
    Cauchy sequence</i>
</p>

<p>

    <i>Proof.</i> \((\Leftarrow)\) For this direction, we start with a Cauchy
    sequence \((x_n)\), which is bounded. So we may use the Bolzano-Weierstrass
    Theorem to produce a convergent subsequence \((x_{n_k})\). Set
    $$
    x = \lim x_{n_k}
    $$
    The idea is to show that the original sequence \((x_n)\) converges to this
    same limit. Once again, we will use a triangle inequality argument. We know
    the terms in the subsequence are getting close to the limit \(x\), and the
    assumption that \((x_n)\) is Cauchy implies the terms in the "tail" of the
    sequence ae close to each other. Thus, we want to make each of these
    distance less than half of the prescribed \(\epsilon\).
</p>

<p>
    Let \(\epsilon > 0\). Because \((x_n)\) is Cauchy, there exists \(N\) such
    that 
    $$
    |x_n - x_m| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}
    $$
    whenever \(m, n \geqslant N\). Now, we also know that \((x_{n_k}) \to x\),
    so choose a term in this subsequence, call it \(x_{n_K}\), with \(n_K
    \geqslant N\) and
    $$
    |x_{n_K} - x| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}
    $$
    To see that \(N\) has the desired property (for the original sequence
    \((x_n)\)), observe that if \(n \geqslant N\), then
    $$
    \begin{align}
    |x_n - x| &= |x_n - x_{n_K} + x_{n_K} - x| \\
    &\leqslant |x_n - x_{n_K}| + |x_{n_K} - x| \\
    &< \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon
    \end{align}
    $$
