    <b>Definition 2.7.9</b>
    Let \(\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k\) be a series. A series \(\sum_{k=1}^\infty
    b_k\) is called a rearrangement of \(\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k\) if there exists
    a one-to-one, onto function \(f : N \to N\) such that \(b_{f(k)} = a_k\) for
    all \(k \in N\)
</p>

<p>
    <b>Definition 2.7.10</b>
    If a series converge absolutely, then any rearrangement of this series
    converges to the same limit
</p>

<p>
    <i>Proof.</i> Assume \(\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k\) converges absolutely to
    \(A\), and let \(\sum_{k=1}^\infty b_k\) be a rearrangement of
    \(\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k\). Let's use
    $$
    s_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k = a_1 + a_2 + \cdot \cdot \cdot + a_n
    $$
    for the partial sums of the original series and use
    $$
    t_m = \sum_{k=1}^n b_k = b_1 + b_2 + \cdot \cdot \cdot + b_m
    $$
    for the partial sums of the rearranged series. Thus we want to show that
    \((t_m) \to A\).

<p>
    Let \(\epsilon > 0\). By hypothesis, \((s_n) \to A\), so choose \(N_1\) such
    that
    $$
    |s_n -A| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}
    $$
    for all \(n \geqslant N_1\). Because the convergence is absolute, we can
    choose \(N_2\) so that
    $$
    \sum_{k=m+1}^n |a_k| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}
    $$
    for all \(n > m \geqslant N_2\). Now, take \(N = max{N_1, N_2}\). We know
    that the finite set of terms \({a_1, a_2, a_3,...,a_N}\) must all appear in
    the rearranged series, and we want to move far enough out in the series
    \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n\) so that we have included all of these terms. Thus
    choose
