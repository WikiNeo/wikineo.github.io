    A set \(O \subseteq R\) is open if for all points \(\alpha \in O\) there
    exists an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood \(V_\epsilon(a) \subseteq O\)
</p>

<p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The union of an arbitrary collection of open sets is open.
    </li>
    <li>
      The intersection of a finite collection of open sets is open.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>

  A point \(x\) is a limit point of a set \(A\) if every
  \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood \(V_\epsilon(x)\) of \(x\) intersects the set \(A\)
  at some point other than \(x\).
</p>

  <i>
    A point \(x\) is a limit point of a set \(A\) if and only if \(x = \lim
    a_n\) for some sequence \((a_n)\) contained in \(A\) satisfying \(a_n \neq
    x\) for all \(n \in N\).
  </i>
</p>

<p>
  A point \(a \in A\) is an isolated point of \(A\)
