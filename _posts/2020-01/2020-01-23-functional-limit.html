    <b>Definition 4.2.1 (Functional Limit)</b>. Let \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\),
    and let \(c\) be a limit point of domain \(A\). We say that \(\lim_{x \to c}
    f(x) = L\) provided that, for all \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists a \(\delta
    > 0\) such that whenever \(0 < |x - c| < \delta\) (and \(x \in A\)) it
    follows that \(|f(x) - L < \epsilon|\)

    <b>Definition 4.2.1B (Functional Limit: Topological Version)</b>. Let \(c\)
    be a limit point of the domain of \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\). We say \(\lim_{x
    \to c} f(x) = L\) provided that, for every \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood
    \(V_\epsilon (L)\) L, there exists a \(\delta\)-neighborhood \(V_\delta
    (c)\) around \(c\) with the property that for all \(x \in V_\delta (c)\)
    different from \(c\) (with \(x \in A\)) it follows that \(f(x) \in V_\delta (L)\)

    <b>Theorem 4.2.3 (Sequential Criterion for Functional Limits)</b>. <i>
        Given a function \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\) and a limit point \(c\) of
        \(A\), the following two statements are equivalent:
        <ol>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ol>
    </i>
