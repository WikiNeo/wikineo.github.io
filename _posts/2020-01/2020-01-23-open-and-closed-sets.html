Given \(a \in \mathbb{R}\) and \(\epsilon > 0\), recall that the
<i>\(\epsilon\)-neighborhood</i> of \(a\) is the set
$$
V_\epsilon (a) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : |x - a| < \epsilon \}
$$
In other words, V_\epsilon (a) is the open interval \((a - \epsilon, a +
\epsilon)\), centered at \(a\) with radius \(\epsilon\)

<p>
  <b>Definition 3.2.1</b>. A set \(O \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is <i>open</i> if
  for all points \(a in O\) there exists an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood
  \(V_\epsilon (a) \subseteq O\)
</p>

<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.2.3</b>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <i>The union of an arbitrary collection of open sets is open.</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>THe intersection of a finite collection of open sets is open</i>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  <b>Definition 3.2.4</b>. A point \(x\) is a <i>limit point</i> of a set \(A\)
  if every \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood \(V_\epsilon (x)\) of \(x\) intersects the
  set \(A\) at some point other than \(x\).
</p>

<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.2.5</b>. <i>
    A point \(x\) is a limit point of a set \(A\) if and only if \(x = \lim
    a_n\) for some sequence \((a_n)\) contained in \(A\) satisfying \(a_n \neq
    x\) for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\)
  </i>
</p>

<p>
  <b>Definition 3.2.6</b>. A point \(a \in A\)  is an <i>isolated point</i> of
  \(A\) if it is not a limit point of \(A\)
</p>

<p>
  <b>Definition 3.2.7</b> A set \(F \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is <i>closed</i> if
  it contains its limit points.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.2.8</b>. <i>
    A set \(F \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is closed if and only if every Cauchy
    sequence contained in \(F\) has a limit that is also an element of \(F\).

</p>

<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.2.10 (Density of \(\mathbb{Q}\) in \(\mathbb{R}\))</b>. <i>
    For every \(y \in \mathbb{R}\), there exists a sequence of rational numbers
    that converges to \(y\).
