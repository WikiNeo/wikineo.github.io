<h2>Discussion: The Cantor Set</h2>







<h2>Open and Closed Sets</h2>
<p>
  <b>Definition 3.2.1 (open)</b>. A set \(O \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is <i>open</i> if
  for all points \(a \in O\) there exists an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood
  \(V_\epsilon (a) \subseteq O\)
</p>
<p>
  <b>Example 3.2.2</b>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Perhaps the simplest example of an open set is \(\mathbb{R}\) itself.
    </li>
    <li>
      Open interval
      $$
      (c, d) = {x \in \mathbb{R} : c < x < d}
      $$
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.2.3</b>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <i>The union of an arbitrary collection of open sets is open.</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>THe intersection of a finite collection of open sets is open</i>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Definition 3.2.4 (limit point)</b>. A point \(x\) is a <i>limit point</i> of a set \(A\)
  if every \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood \(V_\epsilon (x)\) of \(x\) intersects the
  set \(A\) at some point other than \(x\).
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.2.5</b>. <i>
    A point \(x\) is a limit point of a set \(A\) if and only if \(x = \lim
    a_n\) for some sequence \((a_n)\) contained in \(A\) satisfying \(a_n \neq
    x\) for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\)
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Definition 3.2.6</b>. A point \(a \in A\)  is an <i>isolated point</i> of
  \(A\) if it is not a limit point of \(A\)
</p>
<p>
  <b>Definition 3.2.7 (closed)</b> A set \(F \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is <i>closed</i> if
  it contains its limit points.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.2.8</b>. <i>
    A set \(F \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is closed if and only if every Cauchy
    sequence contained in \(F\) has a limit that is also an element of \(F\).
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.2.10 (Density of \(\mathbb{Q}\) in \(\mathbb{R}\))</b>. <i>
    For every \(y \in \mathbb{R}\), there exists a sequence of rational numbers
    that converges to \(y\).
  </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Definition 3.2.11.</b> Given a set \(A \subseteq \mathbb{R}\), let \(L\)
    be the set of all limit points of \(A\). The <i>closure</i> of \(A\) is
    defined to be \(\overline{A} = A \cup L\)
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 3.2.12</b>
    <i>
        For any \(A \subseteq \mathbb{R}\), the closure \(\overline{A}\) is a
        closed set and is the smallest closed set containing \(A\).
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 3.2.13</b>
    <i>
        A set \(O\) is open if and only if \(O^\complement\) is closed.
        Likewise, a set \(F\) is closed if and only if \(F^\complement\) is open.
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 3.2.14</b>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <i>The union of a finite collection of closed sets is closed</i>
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>The intersection of an arbitrary collection of closed sets is closed</i>
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>


<h2>Compact Sets</h2>
<p>
    <b>Definition 3.3.1 (Compactness).</b> A set \(K \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is
    <i>compact</i> if every sequence in \(K\) has a subsequence that converges
    to a limit that is also in \(K\).
</p>
<p>
    <b>Definition 3.3.3</b> A set \(A \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is <i>bounded</i>
    if there exists \(M > 0\) such that \(|a| \leqslant M\) for all \(a \in A\)
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 3.3.4 (Characterization of Compactness in R)</b>. <i>
        A set \(K \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is compact if and only if it is closed
        and bounded.
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 3.3.5 (Nested Compact Set Property)</b>. <i> If
        $$
        K_1 \supseteq K_2 \supseteq K_3 \supseteq K_4 \supseteq \cdot \cdot \cdot
        $$
    is a nested sequence of nonempty compact sets, then the intersection
    \(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty K_n\) is not empty
    </i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Definition 3.3.6</b> Let \(A \subseteq \mathbb{R}\). An <i>open cover</i>
  for \(A\) is a (possibly finite) collection of open sets \(\{O_\lambda :
  \lambda \in \Lambda\}\) whose union contains the set \(A\); that is, \(A
  \subseteq \bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} O_\lambda\). Given an open cover for
  \(A\), a <i>finite subcover</i> is a finite subcollection of open sets from
  the original open cover whose union still manages to completely contain \(A\).
</p>

<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.3.8 (Heine-Borel Theorem)</b>. <i>
    Let \(K\) be a subset of \(\mathbb{R}\). All of the following statements are
    equivalent in the sense that any one of them implies the two others:
    <ol>
      <li>
        \(K\) is compact
      </li>
      <li>
        \(K\) is closed and bounded
      </li>
      <li>
        Every open cover for \(K\) has a finite subcover.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </i>
</p>





<h2>Perfect Sets and Connected Sets</h2>
<p>

  <b>Definition 3.4.1</b> A set \(P \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is <i>perfect</i> if
  it is closed and contains no isolated points.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Definition 3.4.3</b><i>
    A nonempty perfect set is uncountable.
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Definition 3.4.4</b> Two nonempty sets \(A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) are
  <i>separated</i> if \(\overline{A} \cap B\) and \(A \cap \overline{B}\) are
  both empty. A set \(E \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is <i>disconnected</i> if it can
  be written as \(E = A \cup B\), where \(A\) nad \(B\) are nonempty separated
  sets.
  <p>A set that is not disconnected is called a <i>connected</i> set</p>
</p>
<p>

  <b>Theorem 3.4.6</b> <i>
    A set \(E \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is connected if and only if, for all
    nonempty disjoint sets \(A\) and \(B\) satisfying \(E = A \cup B\), there
    always exists a convergent sequence \((x_n) \to x\) with \((x_n)\) contained
    in one of \(A\) or \(B\), and x an element of the other
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.4.7</b> <i>
    A set \(E \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is connected if and only if whenever \(a <
    c < b\) with \(a, b \in E\), it follows that \(c \in E\) as well.
  </i>
