    <b>Definition 4.3.1 (Continuity)</b> A function \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\) is
    <i>continuous at a point</i> \(c \in A\) if, for all \(\epsilon > 0\), there
    exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that whenever \(|x - c| < \delta\) (and \(x \in
    A\)) it follows that \(|f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon\)
    <p>
        If \(f\) is continuous at every point in the domain \(A\), then we say
        that \(f\) is <i>continuous on</i> \(A\)
    </p>

    <b>Theorem 4.3.2 (Characterization of Continuity)</b> <i>
        Let \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\), and let \(c \in A\). The function \(f\) is
        continuous at \(c\) if and only if any one of the following three
        conditions is met:
        <ol>
            <li>
                For all \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such
                that \(|x - c| < \delta\) (and \(x \in A\)) implies \(|f(x) -
                f(c) < \epsilon|\)
            </li>
            <li>
                For all \(V_\epsilon(f(c))\), there exists a \(V_\delta(c)\)
                with the property that \(x \in V_\delta(c)\) (and \(x \in A\))
                implies \(f(x) \in V_\epsilon(f(c))\)
            </li>
            <li>

                For all \((x_n) \to c\) (with \(x_n \in A\)), it follows that
                \(f(x_n) \to f(c)\)
            </li>
            if \(c\) is a limit point of \(A\), then the above conditions are
            equivalent to
            <li>
                \(\lim\limits_{x \to c}f(x) = f(c)\)
            </li>
        </ol>
    </i>
