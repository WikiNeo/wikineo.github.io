    <b>Definition 5.2.1 (Differentiability)</b> Let \(g : A \to \mathbb{R}\) be
    a function defined on an interval \(A\). Given \(c \in A\), the
    <i>derivative of \(g\) at \(c\)</i> is defined by
    $$
    g^\prime(c) = \lim_{x \to c}\frac{g(x) - g(c)}{x - c}
    $$
    provided this limit exists. In this case, we say \(g\) is <i>differentiable
    at \(c\)</i> if \(g^\prime\) exists for all points \(c \in A\), we say that
    \(g\) is differentiable on \(A\)
