<h2>Functional Limits</h2>
<p>
    <b>Definition 4.2.1 (Functional Limit)</b>. Let \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\),
    and let \(c\) be a limit point of domain \(A\). We say that \(\lim_{x \to c}
    f(x) = L\) provided that, for all \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists a \(\delta
    > 0\) such that whenever \(0 < |x - c| < \delta\) (and \(x \in A\)) it
    follows that \(|f(x) - L < \epsilon|\)
</p>
<p>
    <b>Definition 4.2.1B (Functional Limit: Topological Version)</b>. Let \(c\)
    be a limit point of the domain of \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\). We say \(\lim_{x
    \to c} f(x) = L\) provided that, for every \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood
    \(V_\epsilon (L)\) L, there exists a \(\delta\)-neighborhood \(V_\delta
    (c)\) around \(c\) with the property that for all \(x \in V_\delta (c)\)
    different from \(c\) (with \(x \in A\)) it follows that \(f(x) \in V_\delta (L)\)
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 4.2.3 (Sequential Criterion for Functional Limits)</b>. <i>
        Given a function \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\) and a limit point \(c\) of
        \(A\), the following two statements are equivalent:
        <ol>
            <li>
                \(\lim\limits_{x \to c}f(x) = L\)
            </li>
            <li>
                For all sequences \((x_n) \subseteq A\)  satisfying \(x_n \neq
                c\) and \((x_n) \to c\), it follows that \(f(x_n) \to L\)
            </li>
        </ol>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Corollary 4.2.4 (Algebraic Limit Theorem for Functional Limits)</b>. <i>
        Let \(f\) and \(g\) be functions defined on a domain \(A \subseteq
        \mathbb{R}\), and assume \(\lim_{x \to c}f(x) = L\) and \(\lim_{x \to
        c}g(x) = M\) for some limit point \(c\) of \(A\). Then,
        <ol>
            <li>
                \(\lim\limits_{x \to c}kf(x) = kL\) for all \(k \in \mathbb{R}\)
            </li>
            <li>
                \(\lim\limits_{x \to c}[f(x) + g(x)] = L + M\)
            </li>
            <li>
                \(\lim\limits_{x \to c}[f(x)g(x)] = LM\)
            </li>
            <li>
                \(\lim\limits_{x \to c}f(x)/g(x) = L/M\)
            </li>
        </ol>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Corollary 4.2.5 (Divergence Criterion for Functional Limits)</b>. <i>
        Let \(f\) be a function defined on \(A\), and let \(c\) be a limit point
        of \(A\). If there exists two sequence \((x_n)\) and \((y_n)\) in \(A\)
        with \(x_n \neq c\) and \(y_n \neq c\) and
        $$
        \lim x_n = \lim y_n = c \text{ but } \lim f(x_n) \neq \lim f(y_n)
        $$
        then we can conclude that the functional limit \(\lim_{x \to c}f(x)\)
        does not exist.

<h2>Continuous Functions</h2>
<p>
    <b>Definition 4.3.1 (Continuity)</b> A function \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\) is
    <i>continuous at a point</i> \(c \in A\) if, for all \(\epsilon > 0\), there
    exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that whenever \(|x - c| < \delta\) (and \(x \in
    A\)) it follows that \(|f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon\)
    <p>
        If \(f\) is continuous at every point in the domain \(A\), then we say
        that \(f\) is <i>continuous on</i> \(A\)
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 4.3.2 (Characterization of Continuity)</b> <i>
        Let \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\), and let \(c \in A\). The function \(f\) is
        continuous at \(c\) if and only if any one of the following three
        conditions is met:
        <ol>
            <li>
                For all \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such
                that \(|x - c| < \delta\) (and \(x \in A\)) implies \(|f(x) -
                f(c) < \epsilon|\)
            </li>
            <li>
                For all \(V_\epsilon(f(c))\), there exists a \(V_\delta(c)\)
                with the property that \(x \in V_\delta(c)\) (and \(x \in A\))
                implies \(f(x) \in V_\epsilon(f(c))\)
            </li>
            <li>

                For all \((x_n) \to c\) (with \(x_n \in A\)), it follows that
                \(f(x_n) \to f(c)\)
            </li>
            if \(c\) is a limit point of \(A\), then the above conditions are
            equivalent to
            <li>
                \(\lim\limits_{x \to c}f(x) = f(c)\)
            </li>
        </ol>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Corollary 4.3.3 (Criterion for Discontinuity).</b> <i>
        Let \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\), and let \(c \in A\) be a limit point of
        \(A\). If there exists a sequence \((x_n) \subseteq A\) where \((x_n)
        \to c\) but such that \(f(x_n)\) does not converge to \(f(c)\), we may
        conclude that \(f\) is not continuous at \(c\).
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 4.3.4 (Algebraic Continuity Theorem).</b>  <i>
        Assume \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\) and \(g : A \to \mathbb{R}\) are
        continuous at a point \(c \in A.\) Then,
        <ol>
            <li>
                \(kf(x)\) is continuous at \(c\) for all \(k \in \mathbb{R}\)
            </li>
            <li>
                \(f(x) + g(x)\) is continuous at \(c\)
            </li>
            <li>
                \(f(x)g(x)\) is continuous at \(c\)
            </li>
            <li>
                \(f(x)/g(x)\) is continuous at \(c\), provided the quotient is defined.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 4.3.9 (Composition of Continuous Functions)</b> <i>
        Given \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\) and \(g : B \to \mathbb{R}\), assume that
        the range \(f(A) = {f(x) : x \in A}\) is contained in the domain \(B\)
        so that the composition \(g \circ f(x) = g(f(x))\) is defined on A.
        <p>
            If \(f\) is continuous at \(c \in A\), and if \(g\) is continuous at
            \(f(c) \in B\), then \(g \circ f\) is continuous at \(c\)
        </p>
    </i>

<h2>Continuous FUnctions on Compact Sets</h2>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 4.4.1 (Preservation of Compact Sets)</b> <i>
        Let \(f \to \mathbb{R}\) be continuous on \(A\). If \(K \subseteq A\) is
        compact, then \(f(K)\) is compact as well.
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 4.4.2 (Extreme Value Theorem).</b> <i>
        If \(f: K \to \mathbb{R}\) is continuous on a compact set \(K \subseteq
        \mathbb{R}\), then \(f\) attains a maximum and minimum value. In other
        words, there exists \(x_0, x_1 \in K\) such that \(f(x_0) \leqslant f(x) \leqslant
        f(x_1)\) for all \(x \in K\)
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Definition 4.4.4 (Uniform Continuity).</b> A function \(f: A \to R\) is
    <i>uniformly continuous on \(A\)</i> if for every \(\epsilon > 0\) there
    exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that for all \(x,y \in A\), \(|x - y| <
    \delta\) implies \(|f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon\).
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 4.4.5 (Sequential Criterion for Absence of Uniform
    Continuity).</b> <i>
        A function \(f: A \to \mathbb{R}\) fails to be uniformly continuous on
        \(A\) if and only if there exists a particular \(\epsilon_0 > 0\) and
        two sequences \((x_n)\) and \((y_n)\) in \(A\) satisfying
        $$
        |x_n - y_n| \to 0 \text{ but } |f(x_n) - f(y_n)| \geqslant \epsilon_0
        $$
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 4.4.7 (Uniform Continuity on Compact Sets).</b> <i>
        A function that is continuous on a compact set \(K\) is uniformly
        continuous on \(K\)
    </i>
</p>





<h2>The Intermediate Value Theorem</h2>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 4.5.1 (Intermediate Value Theorem).</b> <i>
        Let \(f: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}\) be continuous. If \(L\) is a real
        number satisfying \(f(a) < L < f(b)\) or \(f(a) > L > f(b)\), then there
        exists a point \(c \in (a, b)\) where \(f(c) = L\)
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 4.5.2 (Preservation of Connected Sets).</b> <i>
        Let \(f : G \to \mathbb{R}\) be continuous. If \(E \subseteq G\) is
        connected, then \(f(E)\) is connected as well.
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Definition 4.5.3 (Intermediate Value Property).</b> A function \(f\) has
    the <i>intermediate value property</i> on an interval \([a, b]\) if for all
    \(x < y\) in \([a, b]\) and all \(L\) between \(f(x)\) and \(f(y)\), it is
    always possible to find a point \(c \in (x, y)\) where \(f(c) = L\).
