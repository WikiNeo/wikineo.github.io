The `schema.rb` servers mainly two purposes:

1. It documents the final current state of the database schema. Often,
   especially when you have more than a couple of migrations, it's hard to
   deduct the schema just from the migrations alone. With a present `schema.rb`,
   you can just have a look there. ActiveRecord it self will indeed not use it.
   It will introspect the database during runtime as this is much safer than to
   expect users to keep the `schema.rb` up-to-date. However to avoid confusion
   of your developers, you should always maintain a file that is up-do-date with
   your migrations.
2. It is used by the tests to populate the database schema. As such a `rake
   db:schema:dump` is often run as part of the `test:prepare` run. The purpose
   is that the schema of the test database exactly matches the current
   development database.
