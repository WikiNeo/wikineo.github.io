## CSS2 Introduced Media Types

The `@media` rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different
style rules for different media types.

Examples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for
printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.

Unfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other
than the print media type.

### CSS3 Introduced Media Queries

Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for
a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.

Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

- width and height of the viewport
- width and height of the device
- Orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
- resolution

Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style
sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and
Android phones)
