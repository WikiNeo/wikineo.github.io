The Euler angles are three angles introduced by Leonhard Euler to describe the orientation
of a rigid body with respect to a fixe coordinate system.

## Chained rotations equivalence

Euler angles can be defined by elemental geometry or by composition of rotations. The
geometrical definition demonstrates that three composed elemental rotations (rotations
about the axes of a coordinate system) are always sufficient to reach any target frame.

The three elemental rotations may be extrinsic (rotation about the axes xyz of the
original coordinate system, which is assumed to remain motionless), or intrinsic
(rotation about the axes of the rotating coordinate system XYZ, solidary with the moving
body, which changes its orientation after each elemental rotation).
