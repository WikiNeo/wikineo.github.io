In physics, a rigid body (also known as a rigid object) is a solid body in which
deformation is zero or so small it can be neglected. THe distance between any two given
points on a rigid body remains constant in time regardless of external forces exerted on
it. A rigid body is usually considered as a continuous distribution of mass.

In the study of special relativity, a perfectly rigid body does not exist; an objects can
only be assumed to be rigid if they are not moving near the speed of the light. In quantum
mechanics a rigid body is usually thought of as a collection of point masses. For
instance, in quantum mechanics molecules (consisting of the point masses: electrons and
nuclei) are often seen as rigid bodies.
