Smoke testing, also known as "Build Verification Testing", is a type of software
testing that comprises of a non-exhaustive set of tests that aim at ensuring
that the most important functions work. The result of this testing is used to
decide if a build is stable enough to proceed with further testing. It can also
be used to decide whether to announce a production release or to revert. The
term 'smoke testing', it is said, came to software testing from a similar type
of hardware testing, in which the device passed the test if it did not catch
fire (or smoked) the first time it was turned on.

## ISTQB Definition
