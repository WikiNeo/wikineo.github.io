In object-oriented computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five
design principles intended to make software design more understandable,
flexible, and maintainable.

## Single-responsibility principle

A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one
part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification
of the class.

## Open-closed principle

Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov substitution principle

Objects in a program should be replacable with instances of their subtypes
without altering the correctness of that program

## Interface segregation principle

Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface

## Dependency inversion principle

One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions"
