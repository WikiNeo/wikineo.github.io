The read-only `localStorage` property allows you to access a `Storage` object
for the `Document`'s origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions.
`localStorage` is similar to `sessionStorage`, except that while data stored in
`localStorage` has no expiration time, data stored in `sessionStorage` gets
cleared when the page session ends - that is, when the page is closed. (Data in
a `localStorage` object created in a "private browsing" or `incognito` session
is cleared when the last "private" tab is closed.)
