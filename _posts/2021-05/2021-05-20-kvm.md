KVM, Kernel-based Virtual Machine, is a hypervisor built into the Linux kernel. It is similar to Xen in purpose but much simpler to get running. Unlike native QEMU, which uses emulation, KVM is a special operating mode of QEMU that uses CPU extensions (HVM) for virtualization via a kernel module.

Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified GNU/Linux,
Windows, or any other operating system. (See Guest Support Status for more
information.) Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network
card, disk, graphics card, etc.
