The kernel is the core of an operating system. It functions on a low level
(kernelspace) interacting between the hardware of the machine and the programs
which use the hardware to run. The kernel temporarily stops programs to run
other programs in the meantime, which is known as preemption. This creates the
illusion of many tasks being executed simultaneously, even on single-core CPUs.
The kernel uses the CPU scheduler to decide which program takes priority at any
given moment.
