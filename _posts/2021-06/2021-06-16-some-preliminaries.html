<p>Intuitively speaking, a set is any collection of objects. These objects are referred as
the elements of the set. For our purpose, the sets in question will most often be sets of
numbers, although we will also encounter sets of functions and, on a few occasions, setes
whose elements are other sets.</p>

<p>
    Give a set \(A\), we write \(A \in B\) if \(x\) (what ever if may be) is an element of
    \(A\). It \(x\) is not an element of \(A\), we write \(A \notin B\). Given two sets
    \(A\) and \(B\), the union is written \(A \cup B\) and is defined by asserting that
    $$
    \text{\(x \in A \cup B\) provided that \(x \in A\) or \(x \in B\) (or potentially both)}
    $$
    The intersection \(A \cap B\) is the set defined by the rule
    $$
    \text{\(x \in A \cap B\) provided that \(x \in A\) and \(x \in B\)}
    $$
</p>

<p>
    The set \(\emptyset\) is called the empty set and is understood to be the set that contains
    no elements. An equivalent statement would be to say that \(E\) and \(S\) are disjoint.
</p>

<p>
    The inclusion relationship \(A \subseteq B \) or \(B \supseteq \ A\) is used to
    indicate that every element of \(A\) is also an element of \(B\). In this case, we say
    \(A\) is a subset of \(B\), or \(B\) contains \(A\). To asset that \(A = B\) means
    that \(A \subseteq B\) and \(B \subseteq A \). Put another way, \(A\) and \(B\) have
    exactly the same elements.
</p>

<p>
    As mentioned, most of the sets we encounter will be sets of real numbers. Give \(A
    \subseteq R\), the complement of A, written \(A^\complement\), refers to the set of
    all elements of \(R\) not in \(A\). Thus, for \(A \subseteq R\),
    $$
    \text{\(A^\complement\) = {\(x \in R\) : \(x \notin A\)}}
    $$
    De Morgan's Laws states that
    $$
    \text{
        \((A \cap B)\complement = A^\complement \cup B^\complement\) and 
        \((A \cup B)\complement = A^\complement \cap B^\complement\)
    }
    $$
</p>

<p>
    <b>Definition 1.2.3</b>
    Given two sets \(A\) and \(B\), a function from \(A\) to \(B\) is a rule or mapping
    that takes each element \(x \in A \) and associate with it a single element of \(B\).
    In this case, we write \(f : A \to B\). Given an element \(x \in A\), the expression
    \(f(x)\) is used to represent the element of \(B\) associated with \(x\) by \(f\). The
    set \(A\) is called the domain of \(f\). The range of f is not necessarily equal to
    \(B\) but refers to the subset of \(B\) by \(\text{\{\(y \in B\) : \(y = f(x)\) for some
   \(x \in A\)\} }\).
</p>


<p>
    <b>Triangle Inequality</b>. The absolute value function is so important that it merits
    the special notation \(|x|\) in place of the usual \(f(x)\) or \(g(x)\). It is defined
    for every real number via the piecewise definition
    $$
    |x| = \begin{cases}
    x,  & \text{if $x \geqslant 0 $ } \\
    -x, & \text{if $x < 0$ }
    \end{cases}
    $$
    With respect to multiplication and division, the absolute value functions satisfies
    $$
    |ab| = |a||b|   \\
    |a + b| \leqslant |a| + |b|
    $$
    Verifying these properties is just a matter of examining the different cases that
    arise when \(a\), \(b\) and \(a + b\) are positive and negative. The second property is
    called triangle inequality.
</p>

<p>
    Given three real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we have
    $$
    |a - b| = |(a - c) + (c - b)|
    $$
    By the triangle inequality
    $$
    |(a - c) + (c - b)| \leqslant |a - c| + |c - b|
    $$
    so we get
    $$
    |a - b| \leqslant |a - c| + |c - b|
    $$
    Now, the expression \(|a - b|\) is equal to \(|b - a|\) and is best understood as the
    distance between the points \(a\) and \(b\)  on the number line. With this interpretation,
    we know why it is called triangle inequality.

    Writing rigorous mathematical proofs is a skill best learned by doing, and
    there is plenty of on-the-job training just ahead. As Hardy indicates, there
    is an artistic quality to mathematics of this type, which may or may not
    come easily, but that is not to say that anything especially mysterious is
    happening. A proof is an essay of sorts. It is a set of carefully crafted
    directions, which, when followed, should leave the reader absolutely
    convinced of the truth of the proposition in question. To achieve this, the
    steps in a proof must follow logically from previous steps or be justified
    by some other agreed-upon set of facts. In addition to being valid, these
    steps must also fit coherently together to form a cogent argument.
</p>

<p>

    The one proof we have seen at this point uses an indirect strategy called
    proof by contradiction. This powerful technique will be employed a number of
    times in our upcoming work. Nevertheless, most proofs are direct. (It also
    bears mentioning that using an indirect proof when a direct proof is
    available is generally considered bad form.) A direct proof begins from some
    valid statement, most often taken from the theorem's hypothesis, and then
    proceeds through rigorously logical deductions to a demonstration of the
    theorem's conclusion. An indirect proof always begins by negating what it is
    we would like to prove. The argument then proceeds until a logical
    contraction with some other accepted fact is uncovered. Many times, this
    accepted fact is part of the hypothesis of the theorem. When the
    contradiction is with the theorem's hypothesis, we technically have what is
    called a contrapositive proof.

    <b>Theorem 1.2.6</b>
    Two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are equal if and only if for every real
    number \(\epsilon > 0\) if follows that \( |a - b| < \epsilon\)
</p>

<p>

    There are two key phrases in the statement of  this proposition that warrant
    special attention. One is "for every", the other is "if and only if". To say
    "if and only if" in mathematics is an economical way of stating that the
    proposition is true in two directions. In the forward direction, we must
    prove the statement
</p>

<p>
    if \(a = b\), the for every real number \(\epsilon > 0\) if follows that
    \(|a - b| < \epsilon\)
</p>

<p>

    We must also prove the converse statement
</p>

<p>
    If for every real number \(\epsilon > 0\) it follows that \(|a - b| <
    \epsilon\), then we must have \(a = b\)
</p>

<p>

    For the proof of the first statement, there is really not much to say. if
    \(a = b\), then \(|a - b| = 0\), and so certainly \(|a - b| < \epsilon\) no
    matter that \(\epsilon > 0\) is chosen.
</p>

<p>
    For the second statement, we give a proof by contraction. The conclusion of
    the proposition in this direction states that \(a = b\), so we assume that
    \(a \neq b\). Heading off in search of a contradiction brings us to a
    consideration of the phrase "for every \(\epsilon\)." Some equivalent ways to
    state the hypothesis would be to say that "for all possible choices of
    \(\epsilon > 0\)" or "no matter how \(\epsilon > 0\) is selected, it is always
    the case that \(|a - b| < \epsilon\)." But assuming \(a \neq b\), the choice
    of 
    $$
    \epsilon_0 = |a - b| > 0
    $$
    poses a serious problem. We are assuming that \(|a - b| < \epsilon\) is true
    for every \(\epsilon > 0\), so this must certainly be true for the
    particular \(\epsilon_0\) just defined. However, the statements
    $$
    \text{\(|a - b| < \epsilon_0\) and \(|a - b| = \epsilon_0\)}
    $$
    cannot both be true. This contradiction means that our initial assumption
    that \(a \neq b\) is unacceptable. Therefore, \(a = b\), and the indirect
    proof is complete.
</p>

<p>
    One of the most fundamental skills required for reading and writing analysis
    proofs is the ability to confidently manipulate the quantifying phrases "for
    all" and "there exists."
