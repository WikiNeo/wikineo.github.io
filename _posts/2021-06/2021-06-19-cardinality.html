<h2>1-1 Correspondence</h2>

<p>
    The term cardinality is used in mathematics to refer to the size of a set. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Definition 1.5.1</b>
    A function \(f : A \to B\) is one-to-one \((1-1\)) if \(a_1 \neq a_2\) in \(A\)
    implies that \(f(a_1) \neq f(a_2)\) in \(B\). The function is onto if, given
    any \(b in B\), it is possible to find an element \(a \in A\) for which
    \(f(a) = b\)
</p>

<p>
    A function \(f : A \to B\) that is both \((1-1)\) and onto provides us with
    exactly what we mean by a \((1-1)\) correspondence between two sets. The
    property of being \((1-1)\) means that no two elements of \(A\) correspond
    to the same element of \(B\), and the property of being onto ensures that
    every element of \(B\) corresponds to something in \(A\)
</p>

<p>
    <b>Definition 1.5.2</b>
    The set \(A\) has the same cardinality as \(B\) if there exists \(f : A \to
    B\) that is \(1-1\) and onto. In this case, we write \(A \sim B\)
</p>

<h2>Countable Sets</h2>

<p>
    <b>Definition 1.5.5</b>
    A set \(A\) is countable if \(N \sim A\). An infinite set that is not countable is
    called an uncountable set.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Theorem 1.5.6</b>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The set \(Q\) is countable.
        </li>
        <li>
            The set \(R\) is uncountable.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    <i>Proof.</i>
    <ol>
        <li>


            Set \(A_1 = \{0\}\) and for each \(n \leqslant 2\), let \(A_n\) be
            the set given by
            $$
            A_n = \{\pm\frac{p}{q} : \text{where } p, q \in N \text{ are in lowest terms with } p
            + q = n\}
            $$
            <p>
            The crucial observation is that each \(A_n\) is finite and every
            rational number appears in exactly on of these sets. Our \(1-1\)
            correspondence with \(N\) is then achieved by consecutively listing the
            elements in each \(A_n\)
            </p>
            <p>

                The fact that this line of reasoning applies to any rational number
                \(p/q\) is our proof that the set \(A_n\) were constructed to be
                disjoint so that no rational number appears twice. 

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>

            The second part proof is done by contradiction. Assume that there
            does exist a \(1-1\), onto function \(f : N \to R\). Again, what
            this suggests is that it is possible to enumerate the element of
            \(R\). If we let \(x_1 = f(1)\), \(x_2 = f(2)\), and so on, then our
            assumption that \(f\) is onto means that we can write
            $$
            R = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4,...\}  \tag{1}\label{1}
            $$
            and be confident that every real number appears somewhere on the
            list. We will now use the Nested Interval Property to produce a real
            number that is not there.
            <p>

                Let \(I_1\) be a closed interval that does not contain \(x_1\).
                Next let \(I_2\) be a closed interval, contained in \(I_1\),
                which does not contain \(x_2\). The existence of such an \(I_2\)
                is easy to verify. Certainly \(I_1\) contains two smaller
                disjoint closed intervals, and \(x_2\) can only be in one of
                these. In general, given an interval \(I_n\), construct
                \(I_{n+1}\) to satisfy
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        \(I_{n+1} \subseteq I_n\)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        \(x_{n+1} \notin I_{n+1}\)
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>

                We now consider the intersection \(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n\).
                If \(x_{n_0}\) is some real number from the list \(\eqref{1}\),
                then we have \(x_0 \notin I_{n_0}\), and it follows that
                $$
                x_{n_0} \notin \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n
                $$
            </p>
            <p>

                Now, we are assuming that the list in \(\eqref{1}\) contains
                every real number, and this leads to the conclusion that
                $$
                \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \emptyset
                $$
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the Nested Interval Property (NIP) asserts that
                \(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n \neq \emptyset \). By NIP, there is
                at least one \(x \in \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n\) that,
                consequently cannot be on the list in \eqref{1}. This
                contradiction means that such an enumeration of \(R\) is impossible,
                and we conclude that \(R\) is an uncountable set.
            </p>
        </li>

    </ol>
</p>

<p>

    What exactly should be make of this discovery? It is an important exercise
    to show that any subset of a countable set must be either countable or
    finite. If a set can be arranged into a single list, then deleting some
    elements from this list results in another (shorter, and potentially
    terminating) list. This means that countable sets are smaller type of
    infinite set. Anything smaller is either still countable or finite.
</p>

<p>

    The cardinality of \(R\) is, informally speaking, a larger type of infinity.
    The real numbers so outnumber the natural numbers that there is no way to
    map \(N\) onto \(R\). The set \(Q\), on the other hand, is countable. By
    imitating the demonstration that \(N ~ Z\), we can prove that the union of
    two countable sets must be countable. Because \(R = Q \cup \I\), it follows
    that \(I\) cannot be countable otherwise \(R\) would be. The inescapable
    conclusion is that, despite the fact that we have encountered so few of
    them, the irrational numbers form a far greater subset of \(R\) than \(Q\).
