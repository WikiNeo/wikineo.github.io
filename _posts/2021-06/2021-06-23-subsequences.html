    <b>Definition 2.5.1</b>
    Let \((a_n)\) be a sequence of real numbers, and let \(n_1 < n_2 < n_3 < n_4
    < n_5 < ...\) be an increasing sequence of natural numbers. Then the
    sequence
    $$
    (a_{n_1}, a_{n_2}, a_{n_3}, a_{n_4}, a_{n_5},...)
    $$
    is called a subsequence of \((a_n)\) and is denoted by \((a_{n_k})\), where
    \(k \in N\) indexes the subsequence.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Theorem 2.5.2</b>
    <i>
        Subsequences of a convergent sequence converge to the same limit as the
        original sequence.
    </i>
</p>


<p>
    <i>Proof.</i> Assume \((a_n) \to a\), and let \(a_{n_k}\) be a subsequence.
    Given \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists \(N\) such that \(|a_n - a| <
    \epsilon\) whenever \(n \geqslant N\). Because \(n_k \geqslant k\) for all
    \(k\), the same \(N\) will suffice for the subsequence; that is, \(|a_{n_k}
    - a| < \epsilon\) whenever \(k \geqslant N\)
</p>

<p>
    <b>Theorem 2.5.5</b>
    <b>Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem</b>. <i>Every bounded sequence contains a
    convergent subsequence</i>
</p>

<p>

    <i>Proof.</i> Let \((a_n)\) be a bounded sequence so that there exists \(M >
    0\) satisfying \(|a_n| \leqslant M\) for all \(n \in M\). Bisect the closed
    interval \([-M, M]\) into the two closed intervals \([-M, 0]\) and \([0,
    M]\). (THe midpoint is included in both halves.) Now, it must be that at
    least one of these closed intervals contains an infinite number of the terms
    in the sequence \(a_n\). Select a half for which this is the case and label
    the interval as \(I_1\). Then let \(a_{n_1}\) be some term in the sequence
    \(a_n\) satisfying \(a_{n_1} \in I_1\).
</p>

<p>

    Next, we bisect \(I_1\) into closed intervals of equal length, and let
    \(I_2\) be a half that again contains an infinite number of terms of the
    original sequence. Because there are an infinite number of terms from
    \((a_n)\) to choose from, we can select an \(a_{n_2}\) from the original
    sequence with \(n_2 > n_1\) and \(a_{n_2} \in I_2\). In general, we
    construct the closed interval \(I_k\) by taking a half of \(I_{k-1}\)
    containing an infinite number of terms of \((a_n)\) and then select \(n_k >
    n_{k - 1} > \cdot \cdot \cdot > n_2 > n_1\) so that \(a_{n_k} \in I_l\)
</p>

<p>

    We want to argue that \(a_{n_k}\) is a convergent subsequence, but we need a
    candidate for the limit. The sets
    $$
    I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq I_3 \supseteq \cdot \cdot \cdot
    $$
    form a nested sequence of closed intervals, and by the Nested Interval
    Property there exists at least one point \(x \in R\) contained in every
    \(I_k\). This provides us with the candidate we were looking for. It just
    remains to show that \(a_{n_k} \to x\)
</p>

<p>
    Let \(\epsilon > 0\). By construction, the length of \(I_k\) is \(M(1/2)^{k
    - 1}\) which converges to zero. Choose \(N\) so that \(k \geqslant N\)
    implies that the length of \(I_k\) is less than \(\epsilon\). Because \(x\)
    and \(a_{n_k}\) are both in \(I_k\), it follows that \(|a_{n_k} - x| < \epsilon\)
