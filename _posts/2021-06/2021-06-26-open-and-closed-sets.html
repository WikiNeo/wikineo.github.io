<h2>Open and Closed Sets</h2>
<p>
  <b>Definition 3.2.1 (open)</b>. A set \(O \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is <i>open</i> if
  for all points \(a \in O\) there exists an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood
  \(V_\epsilon (a) \subseteq O\)
</p>
<p>
  <b>Example 3.2.2</b>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Perhaps the simplest example of an open set is \(\mathbb{R}\) itself.
    </li>
    <li>
      Open interval
      $$
      (c, d) = {x \in \mathbb{R} : c < x < d}
      $$
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.2.3</b>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <i>The union of an arbitrary collection of open sets is open.</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>THe intersection of a finite collection of open sets is open</i>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Definition 3.2.4 (limit point)</b>. A point \(x\) is a <i>limit point</i> of a set \(A\)
  if every \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood \(V_\epsilon (x)\) of \(x\) intersects the
  set \(A\) at some point other than \(x\).
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.2.5</b>. <i>
    A point \(x\) is a limit point of a set \(A\) if and only if \(x = \lim
    a_n\) for some sequence \((a_n)\) contained in \(A\) satisfying \(a_n \neq
    x\) for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\)
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Definition 3.2.6</b>. A point \(a \in A\)  is an <i>isolated point</i> of
  \(A\) if it is not a limit point of \(A\)
</p>
<p>
  <b>Definition 3.2.7 (closed)</b> A set \(F \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is <i>closed</i> if
  it contains its limit points.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.2.8</b>. <i>
    A set \(F \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is closed if and only if every Cauchy
    sequence contained in \(F\) has a limit that is also an element of \(F\).
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.2.10 (Density of \(\mathbb{Q}\) in \(\mathbb{R}\))</b>. <i>
    For every \(y \in \mathbb{R}\), there exists a sequence of rational numbers
    that converges to \(y\).
  </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Definition 3.2.11.</b> Given a set \(A \subseteq \mathbb{R}\), let \(L\)
    be the set of all limit points of \(A\). The <i>closure</i> of \(A\) is
    defined to be \(\overline{A} = A \cup L\)
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 3.2.12</b>
    <i>
        For any \(A \subseteq \mathbb{R}\), the closure \(\overline{A}\) is a
        closed set and is the smallest closed set containing \(A\).
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 3.2.13</b>
    <i>
        A set \(O\) is open if and only if \(O^\complement\) is closed.
        Likewise, a set \(F\) is closed if and only if \(F^\complement\) is open.
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 3.2.14</b>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <i>The union of a finite collection of closed sets is closed</i>
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>The intersection of an arbitrary collection of closed sets is closed</i>
        </li>
    </ol>
