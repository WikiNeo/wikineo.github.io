<h2>Compact Sets</h2>
<p>
    <b>Definition 3.3.1 (Compactness).</b> A set \(K \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is
    <i>compact</i> if every sequence in \(K\) has a subsequence that converges
    to a limit that is also in \(K\).
</p>
<p>
    <b>Definition 3.3.3</b> A set \(A \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is <i>bounded</i>
    if there exists \(M > 0\) such that \(|a| \leqslant M\) for all \(a \in A\)
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 3.3.4 (Characterization of Compactness in R)</b>. <i>
        A set \(K \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is compact if and only if it is closed
        and bounded.
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 3.3.5 (Nested Compact Set Property)</b>. <i> If
        $$
        K_1 \supseteq K_2 \supseteq K_3 \supseteq K_4 \supseteq \cdot \cdot \cdot
        $$
    is a nested sequence of nonempty compact sets, then the intersection
    \(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty K_n\) is not empty
    </i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Definition 3.3.6</b> Let \(A \subseteq \mathbb{R}\). An <i>open cover</i>
  for \(A\) is a (possibly finite) collection of open sets \(\{O_\lambda :
  \lambda \in \Lambda\}\) whose union contains the set \(A\); that is, \(A
  \subseteq \bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} O_\lambda\). Given an open cover for
  \(A\), a <i>finite subcover</i> is a finite subcollection of open sets from
  the original open cover whose union still manages to completely contain \(A\).
</p>

<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.3.8 (Heine-Borel Theorem)</b>. <i>
    Let \(K\) be a subset of \(\mathbb{R}\). All of the following statements are
    equivalent in the sense that any one of them implies the two others:
    <ol>
      <li>
        \(K\) is compact
      </li>
      <li>
        \(K\) is closed and bounded
      </li>
      <li>
        Every open cover for \(K\) has a finite subcover.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </i>
