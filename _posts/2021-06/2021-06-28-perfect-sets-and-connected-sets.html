<h2>Perfect Sets and Connected Sets</h2>
<p>

  <b>Definition 3.4.1</b> A set \(P \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is <i>perfect</i> if
  it is closed and contains no isolated points.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Definition 3.4.3</b><i>
    A nonempty perfect set is uncountable.
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Definition 3.4.4</b> Two nonempty sets \(A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) are
  <i>separated</i> if \(\overline{A} \cap B\) and \(A \cap \overline{B}\) are
  both empty. A set \(E \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is <i>disconnected</i> if it can
  be written as \(E = A \cup B\), where \(A\) nad \(B\) are nonempty separated
  sets.
  <p>A set that is not disconnected is called a <i>connected</i> set</p>
</p>
<p>

  <b>Theorem 3.4.6</b> <i>
    A set \(E \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is connected if and only if, for all
    nonempty disjoint sets \(A\) and \(B\) satisfying \(E = A \cup B\), there
    always exists a convergent sequence \((x_n) \to x\) with \((x_n)\) contained
    in one of \(A\) or \(B\), and x an element of the other
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theorem 3.4.7</b> <i>
    A set \(E \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) is connected if and only if whenever \(a <
    c < b\) with \(a, b \in E\), it follows that \(c \in E\) as well.
