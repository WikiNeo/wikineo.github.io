    <b>Definition 4.3.1 (Continuity)</b> A function \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\) is
    <i>continuous at a point</i> \(c \in A\) if, for all \(\epsilon > 0\), there
    exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that whenever \(|x - c| < \delta\) (and \(x \in
    A\)) it follows that \(|f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon\)
    <p>
        If \(f\) is continuous at every point in the domain \(A\), then we say
        that \(f\) is <i>continuous on</i> \(A\)
    </p>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Theorem 4.3.2 (Characterization of Continuity)</b> <i>
        Let \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\), and let \(c \in A\). The function \(f\) is
        continuous at \(c\) if and only if any one of the following three
        conditions is met:
        <ol>
            <li>
                For all \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such
                that \(|x - c| < \delta\) (and \(x \in A\)) implies \(|f(x) -
                f(c) < \epsilon|\)
            </li>
            <li>
                For all \(V_\epsilon(f(c))\), there exists a \(V_\delta(c)\)
                with the property that \(x \in V_\delta(c)\) (and \(x \in A\))
                implies \(f(x) \in V_\epsilon(f(c))\)
            </li>
            <li>

                For all \((x_n) \to c\) (with \(x_n \in A\)), it follows that
                \(f(x_n) \to f(c)\)
            </li>
            if \(c\) is a limit point of \(A\), then the above conditions are
            equivalent to
            <li>
                \(\lim\limits_{x \to c}f(x) = f(c)\)
            </li>
        </ol>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Corollary 4.3.3 (Criterion for Discontinuity).</b> <i>
        Let \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\), and let \(c \in A\) be a limit point of
        \(A\). If there exists a sequence \((x_n) \subseteq A\) where \((x_n)
        \to c\) but such that \(f(x_n)\) does not converge to \(f(c)\), we may
        conclude that \(f\) is not continuous at \(c\).
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 4.3.4 (Algebraic Continuity Theorem).</b>  <i>
        Assume \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\) and \(g : A \to \mathbb{R}\) are
        continuous at a point \(c \in A.\) Then,
        <ol>
            <li>
                \(kf(x)\) is continuous at \(c\) for all \(k \in \mathbb{R}\)
            </li>
            <li>
                \(f(x) + g(x)\) is continuous at \(c\)
            </li>
            <li>
                \(f(x)g(x)\) is continuous at \(c\)
            </li>
            <li>
                \(f(x)/g(x)\) is continuous at \(c\), provided the quotient is defined.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theorem 4.3.9 (Composition of Continuous Functions)</b> <i>
        Given \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\) and \(g : B \to \mathbb{R}\), assume that
        the range \(f(A) = {f(x) : x \in A}\) is contained in the domain \(B\)
        so that the composition \(g \circ f(x) = g(f(x))\) is defined on A.
        <p>
            If \(f\) is continuous at \(c \in A\), and if \(g\) is continuous at
            \(f(c) \in B\), then \(g \circ f\) is continuous at \(c\)
        </p>
