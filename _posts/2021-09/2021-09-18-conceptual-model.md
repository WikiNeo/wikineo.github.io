A conceptual model is a representation of a system. It consists of concepts used
to help people know, understand, or simulate a subject the model represents. It
is also a set of concepts. In contrast, physical models are physical objects;
for example, a toy model which may be assembled, and may be made to work like
the object it represents.

Conceptual model may refer to models which are formed after a conceptualization
or generalization process.[1][2] Conceptual models are often abstractions of
things in the real world, whether physical or social. Semantic studies are
relevant to various stages of concept formation. Semantics is basically about
concepts, the meaning that thinking beings give to various elements of their
experience.
