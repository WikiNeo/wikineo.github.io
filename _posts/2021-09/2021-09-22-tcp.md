## üîß **How TCP Works**

### 1. **Connection Establishment: The 3-Way Handshake**

To start a TCP session, both sides perform a three-step handshake:

1. **SYN** ‚Äì The client sends a synchronize (SYN) message to the server.
2. **SYN-ACK** ‚Äì The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge).
3. **ACK** ‚Äì The client sends back an ACK, and the connection is established.

This ensures both parties are ready to start data transfer.

### 2. **Data Transmission**

- **Segmentation**: TCP breaks application data into manageable segments.
- **Sequence Numbers**: Each byte of data is assigned a number. These help with **ordering** and **detecting loss**.
- **Acknowledgements (ACKs)**: The receiver sends ACKs back to confirm receipt of data.

---

### 3. **Reliability Mechanisms**

- **Retransmission**: If an ACK isn't received in time, TCP resends the data.
- **Checksums**: Each segment includes a checksum to verify data integrity.
- **Duplicate Data Handling**: Duplicate segments are detected and discarded.

---

### 4. **Flow Control (Sliding Window)**

TCP uses a **window size** to control how much data can be sent before waiting for an ACK. This:

- Prevents sender from overwhelming the receiver.
- Allows multiple packets to be in transit (pipeline).

---

### 5. **Congestion Control**

To avoid overloading the network:

- **Slow Start**: TCP starts with a small congestion window (cwnd) and increases it exponentially.
- **Congestion Avoidance**: Once a threshold is reached, it grows linearly.
- **Fast Retransmit & Fast Recovery**: Handle loss without waiting for timeout.

### 6. **Connection Termination: 4-Way Teardown**

TCP closes a connection using a four-step process:

1. **FIN** from one side
2. **ACK** from the other
3. **FIN** from the second side
4. **ACK** from the first side

Each side closes independently.

## üõ†Ô∏è TCP Header (Key Fields)

| Field                           | Purpose                                      |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Source/Destination Port**     | Identifies sending and receiving application |
| **Sequence Number**             | Indicates the position of data               |
| **Acknowledgment Number**       | Confirms received data                       |
| **Flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, etc.)** | Controls connection states                   |
| **Window Size**                 | Flow control mechanism                       |
| **Checksum**                    | Error detection                              |

## üåê Typical Applications

TCP is used when **data accuracy and order** are more important than speed:

- Web browsing (HTTP, HTTPS)
- Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)
- File transfers (FTP)
- Remote terminals (SSH, Telnet)
