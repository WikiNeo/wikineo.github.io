Write a function `bestSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a target sum and an
array of numbers as arguments.

The function should return an array containing the shortest combination of
numbers that add up to exactly the target sum.

If there is a tie for the shortest combination, you may return any one of the shortest.
