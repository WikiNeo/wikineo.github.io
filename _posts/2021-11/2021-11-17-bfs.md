For breadth first traversal, we use a queue to store our data.

1. Similar to the DFS, we start with source in the queue
2. While the queue is not empty, we dequeue/shift the value from front, then enqueue/push the neighbors to the end
3. repeat step 2

## Code

```javascript
const breadthFirstTraversal = (graph, source) => {
	// start with source in queue
	const queue = [source]

	// as long as the queue is not empty
	while(queue.length > 0) {
		// we dequeue the data
		const current = queue.shift()
		console.log(current)

		// enqueue the neighbours of the data
		for(let neighbour of graph[current]) {
			queue.push(neighbour)
		}
	}
}
```
