The algorithm for depth first traversal is that

1. start with a stack with source as starting data
2. while the stack is not empty, pop the stack data. For the popped data, push its neighbors to the stack
3. repeat step 2.

## Explicit Stack

```javascript
const depthFirstTraversal = (graph, source) => {
	// start stack with source
	const stack = [source]
	const visited = new Set()

	// while the stack is not empty
	while(stack.length > 0) {
		// pop the stack data
		const current = stack.pop()

		if(!visited.has(current)){
			visited.add(current)
			console.log(current)
			for(let neighbor of graph[current]) {
				stack.push(neighbor)
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Implicit Stack

```javascript
// Since we are using stack for DFS, we can use function call as implicit stack
// when we print out the value, it is like pop
// when we call a function, it is like push
const visited = new Set()

const depthFirstTraversalRecursive = (graph, source) => {
	visited.add(source)
	console.log(source)

	for(let neighbor of graph[source]) {
		if(!visited.has(neighbor)){
			depthFirstTraversalRecursive(graph, neighbor)
		}
	}
}
```
