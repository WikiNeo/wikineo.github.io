Packages can support having multiple versions installed simultaneously. This is useful for libraries which may have changed interfaces between versions â€” for example, the `gtk+` package can install both versions `2.24` and `3.6` in parallel. This feature is called slotting.

Most packages have no need for slotting. These packages specify `SLOT="0"` in the ebuilds. This is purely a convention; the package manager does not treat `0` any different from other slot values.

## Note: SLOT is a mandatory variable and must not be empty.

Portage permits at most one instance of a package installation per SLOT value. For example, say we have the following:

- `foo-1.1` with `SLOT="1"`
- `foo-1.2` with `SLOT="1"`
- `foo-2.0` with `SLOT="2"`
- `foo-2.1` with `SLOT="2"`

Then the user could have, say, `foo-1.2` and `foo-2.0` installed in parallel,
but not `foo-1.1` and `foo-1.2`. Note that it is entirely possible that the user
may have `foo-2.0` installed and no `foo-1.x` at all.

To `DEPEND` upon a package in a specific slot, refer to SLOT Dependencies.
