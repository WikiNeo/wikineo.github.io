## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```
 
### Constraints:

```
- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 105
```

## Thoughts

- Let's use greedy algorithms and move from end to beginning

## TypeScript

```typescript
function canJump(nums: number[]): boolean {
    let goal: number = nums.length - 1;
    
    for(let i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--){
        if(i + nums[i] >= goal) {
            goal = i
        }
    }
    return goal === 0;
};
```
