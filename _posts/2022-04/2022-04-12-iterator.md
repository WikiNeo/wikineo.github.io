## Real world example

An old radio set will be a good example of iterator, where user could start at
some channel and then use next or previous buttons to go through the
respective channels. Or take an example of MP3 player or a TV set where you
could press the next and previous buttons to go through the consecutive
channels or in other words they all provide an interface to iterate through
the respective channels, songs or radio stations.

## In plain words

It presents a way to access the elements of an object without exposing the underlying presentation.

## Wikipedia says

In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in
which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's
elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some
cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be
decoupled.

## Programmatic example

First of all we have `RadioStation`

```typescript
export class RadioStation {
    protected frequency

    constructor(frquency: number) {
        this.frequency = frquency
    }

    getFrequency(): number {
        return this.frequency
    }
}
```

Then we have our iterator

```typescript
export class StationList implements IterableIterator<RadioStation> {
    protected pointer: number = 0;
    protected stations: RadioStation[] = [];

    addStation(station: RadioStation) {
        this.stations.push(station)
    }

    next(): IteratorResult<RadioStation>{
        if(this.pointer < this.stations.length) {
            return {
                done: false,
                value: this.stations[this.pointer++]
            }
        } else {
            return {
                done: true,
                value: null
            }
        }
    }

    [Symbol.iterator](): IterableIterator<RadioStation>{
        return this;
    }
}
```

And then it can be used as

```typescript
test('IterableIterator next() interface', () => {
    const stationList = new StationList()
    const res = [89, 101, 102, 103.2];
    for(let value of res) {
        stationList.addStation(new RadioStation(value))
    }

    let count = 0;
    while(true){
        let station = stationList.next();
        if(station.done){
            break
        }
        expect(station.value.frequency).toEqual(res[count++])
    }
})

test('IterableIterator let...of interface', () => {
    const stationList = new StationList()
    const res = [89, 101, 102, 103.2];
    for(let value of res) {
        stationList.addStation(new RadioStation(value))
    }

    let count = 0;
    for(let station of stationList){
        expect(station.getFrequency()).toEqual(res[count++]);
    }
})
```
