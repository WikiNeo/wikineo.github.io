## Real world example

A generic example would be you ordering food at a restaurant. You (i.e.
`Client`) ask the waiter (i.e. `Invoker`) to bring some food (i.e. `Command`) and
waiter simply forwards the request to Chef (i.e. `Receiver`) who has the
knowledge of what and how to cook. Another example would be you (i.e. `Client`)
switching on (i.e. `Command`) the television (i.e. `Receiver`) using a remote
control (`Invoker`).

## In plain words

Allows you to encapsulate actions in objects. The key idea behind this pattern
is to provide the means to decouple client from receiver.

## Wikipedia says

In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design
pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to
perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information
includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the
method parameters.

# Programmatic Example

First of all we have the receiver that has the implementation of every action
that could be performed

```typescript
// Receiver
class Bulb {
    protected isOn: boolean = false;

    turnOn() {
        this.isOn = true;
        console.log("Bulb has been lit")
    }

    turnOff() {
        this.isOn = false;
        console.log("Darkness!")
    }

    getStatus(): boolean {
        return this.isOn
    }
}
```

then we have an interface that each of the commands are going to implement and
then we have a set of commands

```typescript
interface Command {
    execute()
    undo()
    redo()
}

class TurnOn implements Command {
    protected bulb;

    constructor(bulb: Bulb) {
        this.bulb = bulb
    }

    execute() {
        this.bulb.turnOn();
    }

    undo(){
        this.bulb.turnOff()
    }

    redo(){
        this.execute()
    }
}

class TurnOff implements Command {
    protected bulb;

    constructor(bulb: Bulb) {
        this.bulb = bulb;
    }

    execute() {
        this.bulb.turnOff()
    }

    undo(){
        this.bulb.turnOn()
    }

    redo(){
        this.execute()
    }
}
```

Then we have an `Invoker` with whom the client will interact to process any
commands

```typescript
class RemoteControl {
    submit(command: Command) {
        command.execute()
    }
}
```

Finally let's see how we can use it in our client

```typescript
test('test command design patterns', () => {
    const bulb = new Bulb();
    const turnOn = new TurnOn(bulb)
    const turnOff = new TurnOff(bulb)

    const remoteControl = new RemoteControl()

    expect(bulb.getStatus()).toEqual(false)
    remoteControl.submit(turnOn)
    expect(bulb.getStatus()).toEqual(true)
    remoteControl.submit(turnOff)
    expect(bulb.getStatus()).toEqual(false)
})
```

Command pattern can also be used to implement a transaction based system.
Where you keep maintaining the history of commands as soon as you execute
them. If the final command is successfully executed, all good otherwise just
iterate through the history and keep executing the `undo` on all the executed
commands.
