<p>
In mathematics, a partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation which
imposes relations between the various partial derivatives of a multivariable
function.
</p>

<p>
The function is often thought of as an "unknown" to be solved for, similarly
to how x is thought of as an unknown number to be solved for in an algebraic
equation like \(x^2 − 3x + 2 = 0\). However, it is usually impossible to write down
explicit formulas for solutions of partial differential equations. There is,
correspondingly, a vast amount of modern mathematical and scientific research
on methods to numerically approximate solutions of certain partial
differential equations using computers. Partial differential equations also
occupy a large sector of pure mathematical research, in which the usual
questions are, broadly speaking, on the identification of general qualitative
features of solutions of various partial differential equations.[citation
needed] Among the many open questions are the existence and smoothness of
solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, named as one of the Millennium Prize
Problems in 2000.

Partial differential equations are ubiquitous in mathematically-oriented
scientific fields, such as physics and engineering. For instance, they are
foundational in the modern scientific understanding of sound, heat, diffusion,
electrostatics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, elasticity,
general relativity, and quantum mechanics (Schrodinger equation, Pauli
equation, etc). They also arise from many purely mathematical considerations,
such as differential geometry and the calculus of variations; among other
notable applications, they are the fundamental tool in the proof of the
Poincaré conjecture from geometric topology.

<p>
Partly due to this variety of sources, there is a wide spectrum of different
types of partial differential equations, and methods have been developed for
dealing with many of the individual equations which arise. As such, it is
usually acknowledged that there is no "general theory" of partial differential
equations, with specialist knowledge being somewhat divided between several
essentially distinct subfields.[1]
</p>

<p>
Ordinary differential equations form a subclass of partial differential
equations, corresponding to functions of a single variable. Stochastic partial
differential equations and nonlocal equations are, as of 2020, particularly
widely studied extensions of the "PDE" notion. More classical topics, on which
there is still much active research, include elliptic and parabolic partial
differential equations, fluid mechanics, Boltzmann equations, and dispersive
partial differential equations.
