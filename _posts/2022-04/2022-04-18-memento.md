## Real world example

Take the example of calculator (i.e. originator), where whenever you perform
some calculation the last calculation is saved in memory (i.e. memento) so
that you can get back to it and maybe get it restored using some action
buttons (i.e. caretaker).

## In plain words

Memento pattern is about capturing and storing the current state of an object
in a manner that it can be restored later on in a smooth manner.

## Wikipedia says

The memento pattern is a software design pattern that provides the ability to
restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback).

## Programmatic Example

Lets take an example of text editor which keeps saving the state from time to
time and that you can restore if you want.

First of all we have our memento object that will be able to hold the editor
state

```typescript
class EditorMemento {
    protected content

    constructor(content: string) {
        this.content = content
    }

    getContent() {
        return this.content
    }
}
```

Then we have our editor i.e. originator that is going to use memento object

```typescript
export class Editor {
    protected content: string = '';

    type(words: string) {
        this.content += words
    }

    getContent() {
        return this.content;
    }

    save() {
        return new EditorMemento(this.content)
    }

    restore(memento: EditorMemento) {
        this.content = memento.getContent()
    }
}
```

And then it can be used as

```typescript
test('test memento design pattern', () => {
    const editor = new Editor();

    editor.type('first')
    expect(editor.getContent()).toEqual('first')
    editor.type('second')
    expect(editor.getContent()).toEqual('firstsecond')

    const saved = editor.save()

    editor.type('third')
    expect(editor.getContent()).toEqual('firstsecondthird')

    editor.restore(saved)
    expect(editor.getContent()).toEqual('firstsecond')
})
```
