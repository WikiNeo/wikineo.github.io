## Real world example

A good example would be the job seekers where they subscribe to some job
posting site and they are notified whenever there is a matching job
opportunity.

## In plain words

Defines a dependency between objects so that whenever an object changes its state, all its dependents are notified.

## Wikipedia says

The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called
the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and
notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of
their methods.

## Programmatic example

Translating our example from above. First of all we have job seekers that need
to be notified for a job posting

```typescript
/**
 * The Observer interface declares the update method, used by subjects.
 */
interface Observer {
    // Receive update from subject.
    update(jobPost: JobPost): void;
}

/**
 * The Subject interface declares a set of methods for managing subscribers.
 */
interface Subject {
    // Attach an observer to the subject.
    attach(observer: Observer): void;

    // Detach an observer from the subject.
    detach(observer: Observer): void;

    // Notify all observers about an event.
    notify(jobPost: JobPost): void;
}

// this is just something we will use in the concrete subject
class JobPost {
    protected title

    constructor(title: string) {
        this.title = title;
    }

    getTitle() {
        return this.title
    }
}

// this is our observer
class JobSeeker implements Observer{
    protected name;
    protected msg: string;

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name
    }

    update(job: JobPost) {
        this.msg = `Hi ${this.name}! New job posted: ${job.getTitle()}`
        console.log(this.msg)
    }

    getMsg(): string {
        return this.msg;
    }
}
```

Then we have our job postings to which the job seekers will subscribe

```typescript
// our subject
class EmploymentAgency implements Subject{
    protected observers: JobSeeker[] = []

    notify (jobPosting: JobPost) {
        this.observers.forEach(observer => observer.update(jobPosting))
    }

    attach(jobSeeker: JobSeeker) {
        this.observers.push(jobSeeker)
    }

    addJob(jobPosting: JobPost) {
        this.notify(jobPosting)
    }
}
```

Then it can be used as

```typescript
test('test observer pattern', () => {
    const johnDoe = new JobSeeker('John Doe')
    const janeDoe = new JobSeeker('Jane Doe')

    const employmentAgency = new EmploymentAgency()
    employmentAgency.attach(janeDoe)
    employmentAgency.attach(johnDoe)

    employmentAgency.addJob(new JobPost('Software Engineer'))

    expect(johnDoe.getMsg()).toEqual('Hi John Doe! New job posted: Software Engineer')
    expect(janeDoe.getMsg()).toEqual('Hi Jane Doe! New job posted: Software Engineer')
})
```
