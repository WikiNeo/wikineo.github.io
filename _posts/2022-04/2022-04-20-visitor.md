## Real world example

Consider someone visiting Dubai. They just need a way (i.e. visa) to enter
Dubai. After arrival, they can come and visit any place in Dubai on their own
without having to ask for permission or to do some leg work in order to visit
any place here; just let them know of a place and they can visit it. Visitor
pattern lets you do just that, it helps you add places to visit so that they
can visit as much as they can without having to do any legwork.

## In plain words

Visitor pattern lets you add further operations to objects without having to
modify them.

## Wikipedia says

In object-oriented programming and software engineering, the visitor design
pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which
it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new
operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures.
It is one way to follow the open/closed principle.

## Programmatic example

Let's take an example of a zoo simulation where we have several different
kinds of animals and we have to make them Sound. Let's translate this using
visitor pattern

```typescript
// visitee
interface Animal {
    accept(operation: AnimalOperation)
}

// visitor
interface AnimalOperation {
    visitMonkey(monkey: Monkey)
    visitLion(lion: Lion)
    visitDolphin(dolphin: Dolphin)
}
```

Then we have our implementations for the animals

```typescript
// implementations for the animals
class Monkey implements Animal {
    shout() {
        console.log('Ooh oo aa aa!');
    }

    accept(operation: AnimalOperation) {
        operation.visitMonkey(this)
    }
}

class Lion implements Animal {
    roar() {
        console.log('Roaaar!');
    }

    accept(operation: AnimalOperation) {
        operation.visitLion(this)
    }
}

class Dolphin implements Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log('Tuut tuttu tuutt!!');
    }

    accept(operation: AnimalOperation) {
        operation.visitDolphin(this)
    }
}
```

Let's implement our visitor

```typescript
// visitor implementation
class Speak implements AnimalOperation {
    visitMonkey(monkey: Monkey) {
        monkey.shout()
    }

    visitLion(lion: Lion) {
        lion.roar()
    }

    visitDolphin(dolphin: Dolphin) {
        dolphin.speak()
    }
}
```

And then it can be used as

```typescript
const monkey = new Monkey();
const lion = new Lion();
const dolphin = new Dolphin();

const speak = new Speak();

monkey.accept(speak)
lion.accept(speak)
dolphin.accept(speak)
```

We could have done this simply by having an inheritance hierarchy for the
animals but then we would have to modify the animals whenever we would have to
add new actions to animals. But now we will not have to change them. For
example, let's say we are asked to add the jump behavior to the animals, we
can simply add that by creating a new visitor i.e.

```typescript
class Jump implements AnimalOperation {
    visitMonkey(monkey: Monkey) {
        console.log('Jumped 20 feet high! on to the tree')
    }

    visitLion(lion: Lion) {
        console.log('Jumped 7 feet! Back on the groud!')
    }

    visitDolphin(dolphin: Dolphin) {
        console.log('Walked on water a little and disappeared')
    }
}
```

And for the usage

```typescript
const jump = new Jump();

monkey.accept(speak)
monkey.accept(jump)

lion.accept(speak)
lion.accept(jump)
```
