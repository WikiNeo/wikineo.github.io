## Real world example

Consider the example of sorting, we implemented bubble sort but the data
started to grow and bubble sort started getting very slow. In order to tackle
this we implemented Quick sort. But now although the quick sort algorithm was
doing better for large datasets, it was very slow for smaller datasets. In
order to handle this we implemented a strategy where for small datasets,
bubble sort will be used and for larger, quick sort.

## In plain words

Strategy pattern allows you to switch the algorithm or strategy based upon the
situation.

## Wikipedia says

In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy
pattern) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables an algorithm's
behavior to be selected at runtime.

## Programmatic example

Translating our example from above. First of all we have our strategy
interface and different strategy implementations

```typescript
interface SortStrategy {
    sort(dataset: number[]): number[];
}

class BubbleSortStrategy implements SortStrategy {
    sort(dataset: number[]): number[] {
        console.log('Sorting using bubble sort')

        return dataset
    }
}

class QuickSortStrategy implements SortStrategy {
    sort(database: number[]): number[] {
        console.log('Sorting using quick sort')
        return database
    }
}
```

And then we have our client that is going to use any strategy

```typescript
class Sorter {
    protected sorter;

    constructor(sorter: SortStrategy) {
        this.sorter = sorter
    }

    sort(dataset: number[]): number[] {
        return this.sorter.sort(dataset)
    }
}
```

And it can be used as

```typescript
test('test strategy', () => {
    const dataset = [1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 8]

    let sorter = new Sorter(new BubbleSortStrategy())
    sorter.sort(dataset)

    sorter = new Sorter(new QuickSortStrategy())
    sorter.sort(dataset)
})
```
