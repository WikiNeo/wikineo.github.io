## Real world example

Suppose we are getting some house built. The steps for building might look
like

- Prepare the base of house
- Build the walls
- Add roof
- Add other floors

The order of these steps could never be changed i.e. you can't build the roof
before building the walls etc but each of the steps could be modified for
example walls can be made of wood or polyester or stone.

## In plain words

Template method defines the skeleton of how a certain algorithm could be
performed, but defers the implementation of those steps to the children
classes.

## Wikipedia says

In software engineering, the template method pattern is a behavioral design
pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation,
deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets one redefine certain steps of an
algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

## Programmatic Example

Imagine we have a build tool that helps us test, lint, build, generate build
reports (i.e. code coverage reports, linting report etc) and deploy our app on
the test server.

First of all we have our base class that specifies the skeleton for the build
algorithm

```typescript
abstract class Builder {
    // template method
    build() {
        this.test()
        this.lint()
        this.assemble()
        this.deploy()
    }

    abstract test();
    abstract lint();
    abstract assemble();
    abstract deploy();
}
```

Then we can have our implementations

```typescript
class AndroidBuilder extends Builder {
    test() {
        console.log('android test')
    }

    lint() {
        console.log('android lint')
    }

    assemble() {
        console.log('android assemble')
    }

    deploy() {
        console.log('android deploy')
    }
}

class IosBuilder extends Builder {
    test() {
        console.log('ios test')
    }

    lint() {
        console.log('ios lint')
    }

    assemble() {
        console.log('ios assemble')
    }

    deploy() {
        console.log('ios deploy')
    }
}
```

And then it can be used as

```typescript
test('test template pattern', () => {
    const androidBuilder = new AndroidBuilder()
    androidBuilder.build()

    const iosBuilder = new IosBuilder()
    iosBuilder.build()
})
```
