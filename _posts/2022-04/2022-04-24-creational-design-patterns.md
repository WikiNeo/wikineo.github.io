## In plain words

Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group
of related objects.

## Wikipedia says

In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that
deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner
suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in
design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns
solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.
