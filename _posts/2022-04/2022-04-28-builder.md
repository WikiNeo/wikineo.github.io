## Real world example

Imagine you are at Hardee's and you order a specific deal, lets say, "Big
Hardee" and they hand it over to you without any questions; this is the
example of simple factory. But there are cases when the creation logic might
involve more steps. For example you want a customized Subway deal, you have
several options in how your burger is made e.g what bread do you want? what
types of sauces would you like? What cheese would you want? etc. In such cases
builder pattern comes to the rescue.

## In plain words

Allows you to create different flavors of an object while avoiding constructor
pollution. Useful when there could be several flavors of an object. Or when
there are a lot of steps involved in creation of an object.

## Wikipedia says

The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern with the
intentions of finding a solution to the telescoping constructor anti-pattern.

Having said that let me add a bit about what telescoping constructor anti-pattern is. At one point or the other we have all seen a constructor like below:

```php
public function __construct($size, $cheese = true, $pepperoni = true, $tomato = false, $lettuce = true)
{
}
```

As you can see; the number of constructor parameters can quickly get out of
hand and it might become difficult to understand the arrangement of
parameters. Plus this parameter list could keep on growing if you would want
to add more options in future. This is called telescoping constructor
anti-pattern.

## Programmatic Example

The sane alternative is to use the builder pattern. First of all we have our
burger that we want to make

```typescript
class Burger {
    protected size: number;

    protected cheese: boolean = false;
    protected pepperoni: boolean = false;
    protected lettuce: boolean = false;
    protected tomato: boolean = false;

    constructor(builder: BurgerBuilder) {
        this.size = builder.size;

        this.cheese = builder.cheese;
        this.pepperoni = builder.pepperoni;
        this.lettuce = builder.lettuce;
        this.tomato = builder.tomato;
    }

}
```

And then we have the builder

```typescript
class BurgerBuilder {
    size: number;
    
    cheese: boolean = false;
    pepperoni: boolean = false;
    lettuce: boolean = false;
    tomato: boolean = false;

    constructor(size: number) {
        this.size = size;
    }

    addPepperoni(){
        this.pepperoni = true;
        return this;
    }

    addLettuce(){
        this.lettuce = true;
        return this;
    }

    addCheese(){
        this.cheese = true;
        return this;
    }

    addTomato(){
        this.tomato = true;
        return this;
    }

    build(): Burger {
        return new Burger(this);
    }
}
```

And then it can be used as:

```typescript
let burger: Burger = (new BurgerBuilder(14))
    .addLettuce()
    .addPepperoni()
    .addTomato()
    .build();
```

## When to use?

When there could be several flavors of an object and to avoid the constructor
telescoping. The key difference from the factory pattern is that; factory
pattern is to be used when the creation is a one step process while builder
pattern is to be used when the creation is a multi step process.
