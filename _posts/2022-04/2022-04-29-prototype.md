## Real world example

Remember dolly? The sheep that was cloned! Lets not get into the details but
the key point here is that it is all about cloning

## In plain words

Create object based on an existing object through cloning.

## Wikipedia says

The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development.
It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical
instance, which is cloned to produce new objects.

In short, it allows you to create a copy of an existing object and modify it
to your needs, instead of going through the trouble of creating an object from
scratch and setting it up.

## Example

```typescript
/**
 * The example class that has cloning ability. We'll see how the values of field
 * with different types will be cloned.
 */
class Prototype {
    public primitive: any;
    public component: object;
    public circularReference: ComponentWithBackReference;

    public clone(): this {
        const clone = Object.create(this);

        clone.component = Object.create(this.component);

        // Cloning an object that has a nested object with back reference
        // requires special treatment. After the cloning is completed, the
        // nested object should point to the cloned object, instead of the
        // original object. Spread operator can be handy for this case.
        clone.circularReference = {
            ...this.circularReference,
            prototype: { ...this },
        };

        return clone;
    }
}

class ComponentWithBackReference {
    public prototype;

    constructor(prototype: Prototype) {
        this.prototype = prototype;
    }
}

/**
 * The client code.
 */
function clientCode() {
    const p1 = new Prototype();
    p1.primitive = 245;
    p1.component = new Date();
    p1.circularReference = new ComponentWithBackReference(p1);

    const p2 = p1.clone();
    if (p1.primitive === p2.primitive) {
        console.log('Primitive field values have been carried over to a clone. Yay!');
    } else {
        console.log('Primitive field values have not been copied. Booo!');
    }
    if (p1.component === p2.component) {
        console.log('Simple component has not been cloned. Booo!');
    } else {
        console.log('Simple component has been cloned. Yay!');
    }

    if (p1.circularReference === p2.circularReference) {
        console.log('Component with back reference has not been cloned. Booo!');
    } else {
        console.log('Component with back reference has been cloned. Yay!');
    }

    if (p1.circularReference.prototype === p2.circularReference.prototype) {
        console.log('Component with back reference is linked to original object. Booo!');
    } else {
        console.log('Component with back reference is linked to the clone. Yay!');
    }
}

clientCode();
```

## When to use?

When an object is required that is similar to existing object or when the creation would be expensive as compared to cloning.
