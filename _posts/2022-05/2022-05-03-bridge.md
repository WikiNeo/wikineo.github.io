## Real world example

Consider you have a website with different pages and you are supposed to allow
the user to change the theme. What would you do? Create multiple copies of
each of the pages for each of the themes or would you just create separate
theme and load them based on the user's preferences? Bridge pattern allows you
to do the second i.e.

## In Plain Words

Bridge pattern is about preferring composition over inheritance.
Implementation details are pushed from a hierarchy to another object with a
separate hierarchy.

## Wikipedia says

The bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is
meant to "decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can
vary independently"

## Programmatic Example

Translating our WebPage example from above. Here we have the `WebPage`
hierarchy

```typescript
interface WebPage {
    getContent();
}

class About implements WebPage {
    protected theme: Theme;

    constructor(theme: Theme) {
        this.theme = theme
    }

    getContent() {
        return `About page in ${this.theme.getColor()}`
    }
}

class Careers implements WebPage {
    protected theme: Theme;

    constructor(theme: Theme) {
        this.theme = theme
    }

    getContent() {
        return `Career page in ${this.theme.getColor()}`
    }
}
```

And the separate theme hierarchy

```typescript
interface Theme {
    getColor();
}

class DarkTheme implements Theme {
    getColor() {
        return 'Dark black';
    }
}

class LightTheme implements Theme {
    getColor() {
        return 'Off white';
    }
}

class QauaTheme implements Theme {
    getColor() {
        return 'Light blue';
    }
}
```

And both the hierarchies

```typescript
const darkTheme = new DarkTheme();

const about = new About(darkTheme)
const careers = new Careers(darkTheme)

about.getContent()
careers.getContent()
```
