## Real world example

How do you turn on the computer? "Hit the power button" you say! That is what
you believe because you are using a simple interface that computer provides on
the outside, internally it has to do a lot of stuff to make it happen. This
simple interface to the complex subsystem is a facade.

## In plain words

Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

## Wikipedia says

A facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of
code, such as a class library.

## Programmatic Example

Taking our computer example from above. Here we have the computer class

```typescript
class Computer {
    getElectricShock(){
        console.log('Ouch!')
    }

    makeSound(){
        console.log('Beep beep!')
    }

    showLoadingScreen(){
        console.log('Loading..')
    }

    bam(){
        console.log('Ready to be used!')
    }

    closeEverything(){
        console.log('Bup bup bup buzzz!')
    }

    sooth(){
        console.log('Zzzzz')
    }

    pullCurrent(){
        console.log('Hahah!')
    }
}
```

Here we have the facade

```typescript
class ComputerFacade {
    protected computer;

    constructor(computer: Computer) {
        this.computer = computer;
    }

    turnOn(){
        this.computer.getElectricShock();
        this.computer.makeSound();
        this.computer.showLoadingScreen();
        this.computer.bam();
    }

    turnOff(){
        this.computer.closeEverything()
        this.computer.pullCurrent()
        this.computer.sooth()
    }
}
```

Now to use the facade

```typescript
let computer = new ComputerFacade(new Computer())
computer.turnOn()
computer.turnOff()
```
