## Real world example

Have you ever used an access card to go through a door? There are multiple
options to open that door i.e. it can be opened either using access card or by
pressing a button that bypasses the security. The door's main functionality is
to open but there is a proxy added on top of it to add some functionality. Let
me better explain it using the code example below.

## In plain words

Using the proxy pattern, a class represents the functionality of another
class.

## Wikipedia says

A proxy, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to
something else. A proxy is a wrapper or agent object that is being called by
the client to access the real serving object behind the scenes. Use of the
proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object, or can provide additional
logic. In the proxy extra functionality can be provided, for example caching
when operations on the real object are resource intensive, or checking
preconditions before operations on the real object are invoked.

## Programmatic Example

Taking our security door example from above. Firstly we have the door
interface and an implementation of door

```typescript
interface Door {
    open();
    close();
}

class LabDoor implements Door {
    open(){
        console.log("Opening lab door")
    }

    close() {
        console.log("Closing the lab door")
    }
}
```

Then we have a proxy to secure any doors that we want

```typescript
class SecuredDoor {
    protected door;

    constructor(door) {
        this.door = door
    }

    authenticate(password) {
        return password === '$ecr@t'
    }

    open(password){
        if (this.authenticate(password)) {
            this.door.open()
        } else {
            console.log("Big no! It ain't possible")
        }
    }

    close() {
        this.door.close()
    }
}
```

And here is how it can be used

```typescript
const door = new SecuredDoor(new LabDoor())
door.open('invalid')

door.open('$ecr@t')
door.close()
```
