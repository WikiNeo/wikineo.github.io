- Client caching - Caching on the client side (browser)

- CDN caching - A Content Delivery Network (CDN) which is a globally distributed network of proxy servers, typically serving static content, is considered a type of cache.

- Web server caching - Caching on the web server or proxy server side, which enables returning client response without contacting the application servers or databases.

- Application server caching - Caching on the application server side, which enables returning client response without contacting the database.

- Database caching - Caching on the database side, which enables returning
client response without executing the queries.
