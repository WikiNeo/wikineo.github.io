The Accept request HTTP header indicates which content types, expressed as
MIME types, the client is able to understand. The server uses content
negotiation to select one of the proposals and informs the client of the
choice with the Content-Type response header. Browsers set required values for
this header based on the context of the request. For example, a browser uses
different values in a request when fetches a CSS stylesheet, image, video, or
a script.
