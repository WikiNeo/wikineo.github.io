Node-dev is a development tool for Node.js that automatically restarts the node process when a file is modified.

In contrast to tools like supervisor or nodemon it doesn't scan the filesystem for files to be watched. Instead it hooks into Node's `require()` function to watch only the files that have been actually required.

This means that you don't have to configure any include- or exclude rules. If you modify a JS file that is solely used on the client-side but never run on the server, node-dev will know this and won't restart the process.

This also means that you don't have to configure any file extensions. Just
require a `.json` file or a `.ts` script for example and it will be watched.
Automatically.

## Usage

Just run `node-dev` as you would normally run `node`:

```shell
node-dev server.js
```

## Command-line options

- `--respawn` - Keep watching for changes after the script has exited
