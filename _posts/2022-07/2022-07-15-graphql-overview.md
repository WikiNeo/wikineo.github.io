1. The GraphQL schema is where your GraphQL types are defined.

2. GraphQL types are connected to each other using fields, and they form a
   graph.

3. The `Query`, `Mutation` and `Subscription` types are special, since they
   act as entry point to the graph.

4. The GraphQL schema acts as the data provider, and it offers a set of
   capabilities the consumer can use.

5. To get data from a GraphQL schema, you need to write a GraphQL operation
   (often referred to as `query`) that selects the data and fields you need.
