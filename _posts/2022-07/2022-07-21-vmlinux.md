**vmlinux** is a statically linked executable file that contains the Linux
kernel in one of the object file formats supported by Linux, which includes
Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), Common Object File Format (COFF) and
a.out.

## Etymology

Traditionally, UNIX platforms called the kernel image `/unix`. With the
development of virtual memory, kernels that supported this feature were given
the `vm-` prefix to differentiate them. The name `vmlinux` is a mutation of
vmunix, while in `vmlinuz` the letter `z` at the end denotes that it is compressed
(for example gzipped).
