Mounting typically involves the attaching of an additional filesystem to the
currently accessible filesystem of a computer.

## Usage

Mount a filesystem. A device file, UUID or label or other means of locating
the partition or data source and a mount point are required. Non-system
relevant filesystems are normally mounted in the /mnt directory. The proper
syntax for mounting a file system is as follows:

```shell
mount <DEVICE> <DIRECTORY>
```

The `/media` directory is generally used to mount removable devices such as USB
drives or SD cards. After determining which device the USB drive shows up as,
a command like the following could be used to mount its contents to a newly
created usb folder in `/media`

```shell
mkdir /media/usb
mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb
```

To unmount a filesystem the device file or the mount point can be specified:

```shell
umount <DEVICE>
umount <DIRECTORY>
```
