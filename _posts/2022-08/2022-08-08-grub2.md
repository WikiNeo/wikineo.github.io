**GRUB 2** (**GR**and **U**nified **B**ootloader version **2**), sometimes stylized as **GRUB2** and
commonly referred to as **GRUB**, is a multiboot secondary bootloader capable of
loading kernels from a variety of filesystems on most system architectures.

## Configuration

### Main configuration file

The **grub-mkconfig** script is used to generate a grub configuration. It uses
the scripts under `/etc/grub.d/*` together with the `/etc/default/grub`
configuration file to generate the final `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` - the only
configuration file used by GRUB2 itself.
