`__slots__` allow us to explicitly declare data members (like properties) and
deny the creation of `__dict__` and `__weakref__` (unless explicitly declared in
`__slots__` or available in a parent.)

The space saved over using `__dict__` can be significant. Attribute lookup speed
can be significantly improved as well.

- `object.__slots__`
  - This class variable can be assigned a string, iterable, or sequence of strings with variable names used by instances. `__slots__` reserves space for the declared variables and prevents the automatic creation of `__dict__` and `__weakref__` for each instance.
