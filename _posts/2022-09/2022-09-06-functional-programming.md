In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.

In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.

Functional programming is sometimes treated as synonymous with purely
functional programming, a subset of functional programming which treats all
functions as deterministic mathematical functions, or pure functions. When a
pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the
same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side
effects. This is in contrast with impure procedures, common in imperative
programming, which can have side effects (such as modifying the program's
state or taking input from a user). Proponents of purely functional
programming claim that by restricting side effects, programs can have fewer
bugs, be easier to debug and test, and be more suited to formal verification.
