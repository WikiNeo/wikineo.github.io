The `get` keyword will bind an object property to a function. When this
property is looked up now the getter function is called. The return value of
the getter function then determines which property is returned.

```javascript
const person = {
    firstName: 'Willem',
    lastName: 'Veen',
    get fullName() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }

}

console.log(person.fullName);
// When the fullname property gets looked up
// the getter function gets executed and its
// returned value will be the value of fullname
```
