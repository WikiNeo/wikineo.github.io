In mathematics and computer science, a **higher-order function** (HOF) is a
function that does at least one of the following:

- takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e. a procedural parameter, which is a parameter of a procedure that is itself a procedure),
- returns a function as its result.

All other functions are *first-order* functions. In mathematics higher-order
functions are also termed operators or functionals. The differential operator
in calculus is a common example, since it maps a function to its derivative,
also a function. Higher-order functions should not be confused with other uses
of the word "functor" throughout mathematics, see Functor (disambiguation).
