Apigee enables you to program API behavior without writing any code, by using policies. A policy is like a module that implements a specific, limited management function. Policies are designed to let you add common types of management capabilities to an API easily and reliably. Policies provide features like security, rate-limiting, transformation, and mediation capabilities, saving you from having to code and maintain this functionality on your own.

You're not limited to the set of policy types provided by Apigee. You can also write custom scripts and code (such as JavaScript applications), that extend API proxy functionality and enable you to innovate on top of the basic management capabilities supported by Apigee policies.
