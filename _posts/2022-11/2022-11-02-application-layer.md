An application layer is an abstraction layer that specifies the shared
communications protocols and interface methods used by hosts in a
communications network. An application layer abstraction is specified in
both the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) and the OSI model. Although both
models use the same term for their respective highest-level layer, the
detailed definitions and purposes are different.
