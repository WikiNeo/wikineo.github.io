A **proxy server** is an intermediate program or computer used when navigating
through different networks of the Internet. They facilitate access to content
on the World Wide Web. A proxy intercepts requests and serves back responses;
it may forward the requests, or not (for example in the case of a cache), and
it may modify it (for example changing its headers, at the boundary between
two networks).

A proxy can be on the user's local computer, or anywhere between the user's
computer and a destination server on the Internet. In general there are two
main types of proxy servers:

- A **forward proxy** that handles requests from and to anywhere on the Internet.
- A **reverse proxy** taking requests from the Internet and forwarding them to servers in an internal network.
