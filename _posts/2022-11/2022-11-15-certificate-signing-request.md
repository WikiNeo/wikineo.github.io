In public key infrastructure (PKI) systems, a certificate signing request
(also CSR or certification request) is a message sent from an applicant to a
certificate authority of the public key infrastructure in order to apply for a
digital identity certificate. It usually contains the public key for which the
certificate should be issued, identifying information (such as a domain name)
and a proof of authenticity including integrity protection (e.g., a digital
signature). The most common format for CSRs is the PKCS #10 specification;
others include the more capable CRMF[1] and the Signed Public Key and
Challenge SPKAC format generated by some web browsers.
