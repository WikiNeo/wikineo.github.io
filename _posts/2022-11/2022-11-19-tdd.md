Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on
software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully
developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the
software against all test cases. This is as opposed to software being
developed first and test cases created later.

Software engineer Kent Beck, who is credited with having developed or
"rediscovered"[1] the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple
designs and inspires confidence.[2]

Test-driven development is related to the test-first programming concepts of
extreme programming, begun in 1999,[3] but more recently has created more
general interest in its own right.[4]

Programmers also apply the concept to improving and debugging legacy code
developed with older techniques.[5]
