**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** is a type of security vulnerability found in web applications. It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into content that is then viewed by other users.

### There are three main types of XSS

1. **Stored XSS**: The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server (e.g., in a comment field or user profile). When another user views the page, the script runs in their browser.
2. **Reflected XSS**: The script is part of the request (like a URL parameter) and is immediately reflected back in the server response. It only runs when a user clicks a specially crafted link.
3. **DOM-based XSS**: The vulnerability exists in the client-side code (JavaScript). It manipulates the DOM in an unsafe way using user input.

### Example

```html
<!-- Vulnerable code -->
<p>Hello, <span id="name"></span>!</p>
<script>
  const params = new URLSearchParams(location.search);
  document.getElementById("name").innerHTML = params.get("user");
</script>
```

If a user visits:

```
example.com/?user=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

The script runs in their browser â€” a basic example of DOM-based XSS.

### Risks

- Stealing session cookies
- Defacing websites
- Redirecting users
- Delivering malware

### Prevention

- Escape or sanitize user input
- Use HTTP-only cookies
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Prefer safe APIs like `textContent` over `innerHTML`
