Web content's **origin** is defined by the scheme (protocol), hostname (domain),
and port of the URL used to access it. Two objects have the same origin only
when the scheme, hostname, and port all match.

Some operations are restricted to same-origin content, and this restriction
can be lifted using CORS.

## Examples

These are same origin because they have the same scheme (`http`) and hostname
(`example.com`), and the different file path does not matter:

- https://example.com/app1/index.html
- https://example.com/app2/index.html

These are same origin because a server delivers HTTP content through port 80 by default:

- https://Example.com:80
- https://example.com

These are not same origin because they use different schemes:

- https://example.com/app1
- https://example.com/app2

These are not same origin because they use different hostnames:

- https://example.com
- https://www.example.com
- https://myapp.example.com

These are not same origin because they use different ports:

- https://example.com
- https://example.com:8080
