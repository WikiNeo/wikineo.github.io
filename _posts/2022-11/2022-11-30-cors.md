**CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a system, consisting of transmitting
HTTP headers, that determines whether browsers block frontend JavaScript code
from accessing responses for cross-origin requests.

The same-origin security policy forbids cross-origin access to resources. But
CORS gives web servers the ability to say they want to opt into allowing
cross-origin access to their resources.
