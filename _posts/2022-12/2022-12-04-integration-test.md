**Integration Testing** is defined as a type of testing where software modules are
integrated logically and tested as a group. A typical software project
consists of multiple software modules, coded by different programmers. The
purpose of this level of testing is to expose defects in the interaction
between these software modules when they are integrated

Integration Testing focuses on checking data communication amongst these
modules. Hence it is also termed as *‘I & T’* (Integration and Testing), *‘String
Testing’* and sometimes *‘Thread Testing’*.
