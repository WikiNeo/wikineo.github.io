In computing, endianness is the order or sequence of bytes of a word of
digital data in computer memory. Endianness is primarily expressed as
big-endian (BE) or little-endian (LE). A big-endian system stores the most
significant byte of a word at the smallest memory address and the least
significant byte at the largest. A little-endian system, in contrast, stores
the least-significant byte at the smallest address. Bi-endianness is
a feature supported by numerous computer architectures that feature switchable
endianness in data fetches and stores or for instruction fetches. Other
orderings are generically called middle-endian or mixed-endian.

Endianness may also be used to describe the order in which the bits are
transmitted over a communication channel[citation needed], e.g., big-endian in
a communications channel transmits the most significant bits
first. Bit-endianness is seldom used in other contexts.
