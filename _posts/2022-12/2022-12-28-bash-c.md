```man
SYNOPSIS
       bash [options] [command_string | file]
OPTIONS
       All  of  the  single-character shell options documented in the description of the set builtin command, in‐
       cluding -o, can be used as options when the shell is invoked.  In addition, bash interprets the  following
       options when it is invoked:

       -c        If  the  -c  option  is  present, then commands are read from the first non-option argument com‐
                 mand_string.  If there are arguments after the command_string, the first argument is assigned to
                 $0  and any remaining arguments are assigned to the positional parameters.  The assignment to $0
                 sets the name of the shell, which is used in warning and error messages.
