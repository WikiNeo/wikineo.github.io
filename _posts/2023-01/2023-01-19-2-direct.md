```shell
scriptlist=`ls $directory_/fallback_* 2> /dev/null`
```

File descriptor `2` represents standard error. (other special file descriptors
include `0` for standard input and `1` for standard output).

`2> /dev/null` means to redirect standard error to `/dev/null`. `/dev/null` is a special device that discards everything that is written to it.

Putting all together, this line of code stores the standard output of command `ls $directory_/fallback_* 2> /dev/null` into the variable `scriptlist`, and the standard error is discarded.
