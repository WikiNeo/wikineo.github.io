uWSGI is an open source software application that "aims at developing a full
stack for building hosting services".[3] It is named after the Web Server
Gateway Interface (WSGI), which was the first plugin supported by the
project.[3] uWSGI is maintained by Italian based software company unbit.[4]

uwsgi (all lowercase) is the native binary protocol that uWSGI uses to
communicate with other servers.[5]

uWSGI is often used in conjunction with web servers such as Cherokee and
Nginx, which offer direct support for uWSGI's native uwsgi protocol, to serve
Python web applications such as Django.[6] For example, data may flow like
this: HTTP client ↔ Nginx ↔ uWSGI ↔ Python app.[7]

A common alternative to uWSGI is Gunicorn.
