AWS Cloud computing resources are housed in highly available data center
facilities. To provide additional scalability and reliability, these data
center facilities are located in different physical locations. These locations
are categorized by regions and Availability Zones.

AWS Regions are large and widely dispersed into separate geographic locations.
Availability Zones are distinct locations within an AWS Region that are
engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. They
provide inexpensive, low-latency network connectivity to other Availability
Zones in the same AWS Region.

## Important

Each region is completely independent. Any ElastiCache activity you initiate
(for example, creating clusters) runs only in your current default region.
