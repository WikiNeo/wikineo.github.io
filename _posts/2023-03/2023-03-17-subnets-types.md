## Subnet types

Depending on how you configure routing for your subnets, they are considered
either public, private, or VPN-only:

**Public subnet**: The subnet has a direct route to an internet gateway. Resources
in a public subnet can access the public internet.

**Private subnet**: The subnet does not have a direct route to an internet
gateway. Resources in a private subnet require a NAT device to access the
public internet.

**VPN-only subnet**: The subnet has a route to a Site-to-Site VPN connection
through a virtual private gateway. The subnet does not have a route to an
internet gateway.

When you create a subnet, you specify its IP addresses, depending on the
configuration of the VPC:

**IPv4 only**: The subnet has an IPv4 CIDR block but does not have an IPv6
CIDR block. Resources in an IPv4-only subnet must communicate over IPv4.

**Dual stack**: The subnet has both an IPv4 CIDR block and an IPv6 CIDR block.
The VPC must have both an IPv4 CIDR block and an IPv6 CIDR block. Resources in
a dual-stack subnet can communicate over IPv4 and IPv6.

**IPv6 only**: The subnet has an IPv6 CIDR block but does not have an IPv4
CIDR block. The VPC must have an IPv6 CIDR block. Resources in an IPv6-only
subnet must communicate over IPv6.

Regardless of the type of subnet, the internal IPv4 address range of the
subnet is always privateâ€”we do not announce the address block to the internet.
For more information about private IP addressing in VPCs, see IP addressing.
