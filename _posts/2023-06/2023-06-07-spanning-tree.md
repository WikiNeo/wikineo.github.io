In the mathematical field of graph theory, a **spanning tree** *T* of an undirected
graph *G* is a subgraph that is a tree which includes all of the vertices of
*G*.[1] In general, a graph may have several spanning trees, but a graph that is
not connected will not contain a spanning tree (see about spanning forests
below). If all of the edges of *G* are also edges of a spanning tree *T* of *G*,
then *G* is a tree and is identical to *T* (that is, a tree has a unique spanning
tree and it is itself).
