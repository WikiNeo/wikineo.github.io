OAuth (short for "Open Authorization"[1][2]) is an open standard for access
delegation, commonly used as a way for internet users to grant websites or
applications access to their information on other websites but without giving
them the passwords.[3][4] This mechanism is used by companies such as
Amazon,[5] Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter to permit users to share
information about their accounts with third-party applications or websites.

Generally, the OAuth protocol provides a way for resource owners to provide a
client [application] with secure delegated access to server resources. It
specifies a process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to
their server resources without providing credentials. Designed specifically to
work with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), OAuth essentially allows access
tokens to be issued to third-party clients by an authorization server, with
the approval of the resource owner. The third party then uses the access token
to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.[2]
