## Key Difference Between Modem and Router

- A Modem is a device that modulates an analog signal to translate digital information, whereas Router is a computer networking device that manages the data entering and leaving the network as well as data moving inside of the network.
- A modem operates on the Datalink layer, while Router can be operated at the Data Link Layer, Network Layer, and Physical Layer.
- Modem brings in the requested information from the internet to your network whereas router distributes the requested information to your PC or laptop.
- Modem does not help to examine the data packet whereas Router examines all data packets before forwarding it.
- A modem is used for accessing the internet as it connects your computer to
  the ISP and Router is used to access the internet without using a modem.

## What is Modem?

A Modem (modulator-demodulator) is a device that modulates an analog signal to
digital information. It also decodes carrier signals to demodulate the
transmitted information. The main aim of the modem is to produce a signal that
can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the digital data in its
original form. Modems are also used for transmitting analog signals, from
Light Emitting Diodes (LED) to radio.

## What is Router?

Router is a computer networking device that serves two primary functions: (1)
create and maintain a local area network and (2) manage the data entering and
leaving the network as well as data moving inside of the network. It also
helps you to handle multiple networks and routes network traffic between them.
In your home network, your router has one connection to the Internet and one
connection to your private local network. Moreover, most routers also contain
built-in switches that allow you to connect multiple wired devices.
