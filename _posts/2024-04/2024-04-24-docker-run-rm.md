If you want to remove the container after running while overriding the containerâ€™s restart policy, use the `--rm` flag:

```shell
docker compose run --rm web python manage.py db upgrade
```

This runs a database upgrade script, and removes the container when finished running, even if a restart policy is
specified in the service configuration.
