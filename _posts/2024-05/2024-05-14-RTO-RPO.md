## Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

RTO is the goal your organization sets for the maximum length of time it should take to restore normal operations
following an outage or data loss.

## Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

RPO is your goal for the maximum amount of data the organization can tolerate losing. This parameter is measured in
time: from the moment a failure occurs to your last valid data backup. For example, if you experience a failure now and
your last full data backup was 24 hours ago, the RPO is 24 hours.
