```shell
CTRL-W s						*CTRL-W_s*
CTRL-W S						*CTRL-W_S*
CTRL-W CTRL-S						*CTRL-W_CTRL-S*
:[N]sp[lit] [++opt] [+cmd] [file]			*:sp* *:split*
		Split current window in two.  The result is two viewports on
		the same file.

		Make the new window N high (default is to use half the height
		of the current window).  Reduces the current window height to
		create room (and others, if the 'equalalways' option is set,
		'eadirection' isn't "hor", and one of them is higher than the
		current or the new window).

		If [file] is given it will be edited in the new window.  If it
		is not loaded in any buffer, it will be read.  Else the new
		window will use the already loaded buffer.

		Note: CTRL-S does not work on all terminals and might block
		further input, use CTRL-Q to get going again.
		Also see |++opt| and |+cmd|.

		Be careful when splitting a window in an autocommand, it may
		mess up the window layout if this happens while making other
		window layout changes.
