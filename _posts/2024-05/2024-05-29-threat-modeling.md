In the context of application security, threat modeling is a structured,
repeatable process used to gain actionable insights into the security
characteristics of a particular system. It involves modeling a system from a
security perspective, identifying applicable threats based on this model, and
determining responses to these threats. Threat modeling analyzes a system from
an adversarial perspective, focusing on ways in which an attacker can exploit a
system.

Threat modeling is ideally performed early in the SDLC, such as during the
design phase. Moreover, it is not something that is performed once and never
again. A threat model is something that should be maintained, updated and
refined alongside the system. Ideally, threat modeling should be integrated
seamlessly into a team's normal SDLC process; it should be treated as standard
and necessary step in the process, not an add-on.
