- CTRL-R {register} `*i_CTRL-R*`
  - Insert the contents of a register. Between typing CTRL-R and
    the second character, '"' will be displayed to indicate that
    you are expected to enter the name of a register.
    The text is inserted as if you typed it, but mappings and
    abbreviations are not used. If you have options like
    'textwidth', 'formatoptions', or 'autoindent' set, this will
    influence what will be inserted. This is different from what
    happens with the "p" command and pasting with the mouse.

## Special registers

- '"' the unnamed register, containing the text of the last delete or yank
- '%' the current file name
- '#' the alternate file name
- "\*" the clipboard contents (X11: primary selection)
- '+' the clipboard contents
- '/' the last search pattern
- ':' the last command-line
- '.' the last inserted text
- '-' the last small (less than a line) delete
  register. This is repeatable using |.| since
  it remembers the register to put instead of
  the literal text to insert.
- '=' the expression register: you are prompted to
  enter an expression (see |expression|)
