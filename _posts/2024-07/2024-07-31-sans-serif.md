In typography and lettering, a sans-serif, sans serif (/ˈsæn(z) ˈsɛrɪf/),
gothic, or simply sans letterform is one that does not have extending features
called "serifs" at the end of strokes.[1] Sans-serif typefaces tend to have less
stroke width variation than serif typefaces. They are often used to convey
simplicity and modernity or minimalism. For the purposes of type classification,
sans-serif designs are usually divided into these major groups: § Grotesque, §
Neo-grotesque, § Geometric, § Humanist, and § Other or mixed.

Sans-serif typefaces have become the most prevalent for display of text on
computer screens. On lower-resolution digital displays, fine details like serifs
may disappear or appear too large. The term comes from the French word sans,
meaning "without" and "serif" of uncertain origin, possibly from the Dutch word
schreef meaning "line" or pen-stroke.[2] In printed media, they are more
commonly used for display use and less for body text.

Before the term "sans-serif" became standard in English typography, a number of
other terms had been used. One of these terms for sans-serif was "grotesque",
often used in Europe, and "gothic", which is still used in East Asian typography
and sometimes seen in typeface names like News Gothic, Highway Gothic, Franklin
Gothic or Trade Gothic.

Sans-serif typefaces are sometimes, especially in older documents, used as a
device for emphasis, due to their typically blacker type color.
