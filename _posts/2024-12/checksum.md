A checksum is a value used to verify the integrity of data. It is typically a short string of numbers and letters generated by applying a mathematical algorithm (e.g., MD5, SHA-256, CRC32) to a piece of data like a file or a message. The checksum ensures that the data has not been altered or corrupted during storage or transmission.

## How it Works:

1. Checksum Generation: A checksum value is computed from the original data using a specific algorithm.
2. Transmission or Storage: The data and its checksum are sent or saved together.
3. Verification:
   - The recipient recalculates the checksum from the received data.
   - The recalculated checksum is compared to the original checksum.
   - If the values match, the data is assumed to be intact. If not, it indicates corruption or tampering.
