`jq -r` is a command-line option for the `jq` tool, which is used for processing JSON data. The `-r` (or `--raw-output`) flag tells `jq` to output strings as raw text rather than JSON-encoded strings.

## Example Usage:

### 1. Without -r (default behavior):

```shell
echo '{"name": "Alice"}' | jq '.name'
```

**Output:**

```shell
"Alice"
```

(Quotes remain because the output is still JSON-encoded) 2. With -r:

echo '{"name": "Alice"}' | jq -r '.name'

Output:

Alice

(No quotes, just raw text)
When to Use -r

    When you need plain text output (e.g., when storing results in a variable or passing them to another command).
    When working with JSON data that includes URLs, filenames, or command outputs that should not be wrapped in quotes.
