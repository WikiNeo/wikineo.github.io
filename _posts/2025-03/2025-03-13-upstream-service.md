An **upstream service** is a service that another service (the **downstream service**) depends on or receives data from. The term is commonly used in distributed systems, microservices, and networking.

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Data Flow Perspective**

   - **Upstream Service**: Sends data or performs operations that another service relies on.
   - **Downstream Service**: Receives data or responses from the upstream service.

2. **Examples in Different Contexts**

   - **Microservices**:
     - A payment service (downstream) may call an authentication service (upstream) to verify user credentials.
   - **Networking**:
     - A web browser (downstream) requests data from a web server (upstream).
   - **APIs**:
     - A frontend app (downstream) fetches data from a backend API (upstream).

3. **Failure Propagation**
   - If an upstream service fails, downstream services may be affected unless they have fallback mechanisms (like caching or retries).
