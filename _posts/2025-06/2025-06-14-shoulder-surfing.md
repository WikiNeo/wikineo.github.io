**Shoulder surfing** is a type of social engineering attack where someone observes a person’s private information by literally looking over their shoulder — or from a nearby vantage point — without their knowledge.

### Common targets include

- **PIN codes** entered at ATMs or point-of-sale terminals
- **Passwords** typed into computers or phones
- **Confidential information** on screens (e.g., emails, financial data)

### Real-world examples

- A person watches you enter your phone passcode on public transport
- Someone behind you in a queue sees your ATM PIN
- In a café, someone glances at your laptop screen while you check work emails

### How to protect yourself

- Use privacy screens on laptops and phones
- Shield your keyboard or screen when entering sensitive data
- Be aware of your surroundings in public spaces
