**WSGI** stands for **Web Server Gateway Interface**. It's a standard interface between **web servers** and **Python web applications or frameworks**. It allows you to write web applications in Python that can run on any WSGI-compatible web server.

---

### ðŸ”§ How it works (high-level):

- The **web server** (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI) receives an HTTP request.
- It forwards the request to your **Python app** via a **WSGI interface**.
- Your **Python app** returns a response (status, headers, body) through the WSGI interface.
- The server sends the response back to the client.

---

### ðŸ“„ WSGI Application Example:

```python
def application(environ, start_response):
    status = '200 OK'
    headers = [('Content-Type', 'text/plain')]
    start_response(status, headers)
    return [b"Hello, World!"]
```

- `environ`: A dict with request info (method, path, headers, etc.)
- `start_response`: A function used to send status and headers to the server

---

### âœ… Why WSGI is useful:

- Standardizes the way Python web apps and servers communicate
- Lets you run frameworks like **Flask**, **Django**, or **FastAPI (via ASGI fallback)** on WSGI servers
- Enables switching between servers without changing your app

---

### ðŸ”„ WSGI vs ASGI:

- **WSGI**: Synchronous (traditional apps like Django, Flask)
- **ASGI**: Asynchronous + synchronous (supports WebSockets, long polling â€“ for FastAPI, Django Channels)
