A **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack** is a type of cyberattack where an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.

### How it works:

1. **Interception**: The attacker gets in between the client and the server (e.g., your browser and a website).
2. **Eavesdropping**: The attacker reads the data being exchanged (e.g., login credentials, credit card info).
3. **Manipulation** (optional): The attacker can alter the data before passing it on (e.g., changing payment details).

### Common scenarios:

- **Unsecured Wi-Fi networks**: An attacker on the same public Wi-Fi can intercept data.
- **DNS spoofing**: Redirects users to a fake website.
- **HTTPS stripping**: Downgrades secure HTTPS connections to unencrypted HTTP.

### Protection methods:

- Use **HTTPS** (SSL/TLS encryption).
- Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks.
- Use **VPNs**.
- Employ **strong authentication** methods.
- Validate SSL certificates when connecting to websites.
