A **log scale** (short for **logarithmic scale**) is a way of displaying numerical data that uses the **logarithm of values** instead of the values themselves. This means:

- On a **linear scale**, equal distances represent equal increments (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4...).
- On a **log scale**, equal distances represent **multiplicative** increments (e.g., 1, 10, 100, 1000... if using log base 10).

### Why use a log scale?

1. **Handle wide ranges**: Useful when data spans several orders of magnitude (e.g., 1 to 1,000,000).
2. **Reveal exponential trends**: Exponential growth appears as a **straight line** on a log scale.
3. **Compress large values**: Makes plots more readable when large values would otherwise dominate.

### Example

| Value | Log10(Value) |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 1     | 0            |
| 10    | 1            |
| 100   | 2            |
| 1000  | 3            |

A plot of these values on a **log scale** would space 1, 10, 100, and 1000 **equally**, even though their actual differences are large.
