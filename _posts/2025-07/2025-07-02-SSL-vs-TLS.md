**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** and **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** are both cryptographic protocols designed to provide **secure communication over a network**, such as HTTPS. Here's a comparison:

### üîí TLS vs SSL: Key Differences

| Feature               | SSL                          | TLS                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Full Name**         | Secure Sockets Layer         | Transport Layer Security           |
| **Versions**          | SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0 (obsolete)  | TLS 1.0 ‚Äì 1.3 (TLS 1.3 is current) |
| **Security**          | Weak, vulnerable to attacks  | Stronger, more secure              |
| **Status**            | Deprecated (since 2015)      | Actively maintained                |
| **Handshake Process** | Less efficient, less secure  | Improved with stronger ciphers     |
| **Cipher Suites**     | Supports outdated algorithms | Modern, secure algorithms          |
| **Performance**       | Slower                       | Faster (especially in TLS 1.3)     |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Summary:

- **SSL is outdated and insecure**. It should **never be used** today.
- **TLS is the modern standard**, with **TLS 1.3** being the latest and most secure version.
- When people say "SSL certificates," they really mean **TLS certificates**‚Äîthe term just stuck.
